# Overkill

In the unnamed System, it is possible to get very large pools of dice to roll. Overkill is a rule designed to help deal with these large pools of dice in a sane fashion.

Basically, any time you have 5 dice, you can trade them for 1 Success without rolling them. So if you have a pool of 7d, you can trade 5d for a Success and then roll the remaining 2d. This has three effects:

1. **It streamlines gameplay** - if a minimal success is sufficient, then the player can stop building their pool when they reach 5d. 
2. **It shows expertise** - if you can get your pool up to at least 5d, you have a reliable level of competence in what you're trying to do, and can consistently perform at at least a passable level.
3. **It keeps the number of dice rolled sane** - Smaller rolled dice can be counted for successes more quickly, and are less likely to take over your game table.

In addition to this use of Overkill, however, there is an additional rule for very large numbers of dice.

## The Dice Cap

The most dice you can roll for any given task is 10. Any dice beyond 10 *only count as Overkill Successes in intervals of 5 dice*. So if you have a pool of 14 dice, you can only roll 10 of them, and the extra 4 don't count. Find another die for the pool, though, and you'll get a free success.

Note that the rule is that you cannot *roll* more than 10 dice. It doesn't cap the dice pool, just the number of dice rolled. So in the 14 pool example above, you could trade 10 dice for 2 successes and roll the remaining 4, or trade 5 dice for a success and roll the remaining 9.
