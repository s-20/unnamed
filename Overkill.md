# Overkill

If you are really good at something, it can be assumed that you will succeed to a certain degree. Any time you can pull 5d into a check, you can trade those dice for a free Success. Generally speaking, if the degree of success doesn't matter and the task only requires 1 success, you just succeed and move on.

You cannot roll more than 10d for a single check. You may convert as many dice as you like into Successes as described above, however, so if you have 14d in a pool, you can convert 5d into one success and roll 9, or convert 10d into two successes and roll 4.

Overkill can be applied at any time, including in combat or other moments of high tension. Overkill means you have a certain minimum ability that you can count on pretty much at all times.

Overkill does not apply to checks involving [Meta Traits](MetaTraits.md), and may not apply to certain [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md) checks.
