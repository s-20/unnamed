# Overkill

If you are really good at something, it can be assumed that you will succeed to a certain degree. Any time you can pull 5d into a check, you can trade those dice for 1 [Effort](Effort.md). Generally speaking, if the degree of success doesn't matter and the task has a difficulty of 1, you just succeed and move on.

You cannot roll more than 10d for a single check. You may convert as many dice as you like into Effort as described above, however, so if you have 14d in a pool, you can convert 5d into 1 Effort and roll 9d, or convert 10d into 2 Effort and roll 4d.

Overkill can be applied at any time, including in combat or other moments of high tension. Overkill means you have a certain minimum ability that you can count on pretty much at all times.
