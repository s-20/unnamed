# Overkill

You only roll up to 5 dice at a time. Any dice in your pool beyond that is considered Overkill, and can earn you free successes or Perks.

With a roll using [Normal Dice](DiceTypes.md), you gain **Overkill** for every 5 extra dice - that means 1 free Success, or 1 [Perk](Perks.md). Otherwise, extra dice are ignored, except in the case of a tie with an opposed roll (the character with the highest total dice in the check wins all ties).

If you're really good at something, however, things change a bit.

## In Your Wheelhouse

If you can pull something into the check that gives you [Easy Dice](DiceTypes.md), then the check is "in your wheelhouse", and you gain **Overkill** for every three dice you can pull beyond 5.

If the dice would become Simple Dice - for instance, you [Burn](Burn.md) an Aspect and have a Focus in the check - you can either use the rules listed for Easy Dice above, or you can just convert every 2 dice into an **Overkill**, and not roll at all. Remember that once you hit Simple Dice, it stops being about *whether* you can do something, and becomes about *how well* you accomplish the task.
