# Overkill

Overkill represents [Effort](Effort.md) you don't need from one check that rolls over into another related check. It is a special instance of a [Stunt](Stunts.md) that is always available, provided the next action follows on from the preceding immediately, or close enough to immediately as makes no odds.

Overkill works in one of two ways. The main way it works is by applying the Effort as bonus dice to another related check more or less immediately after the first. The other way, available only in combat, allows you to take an additional free action related to the one that provided Overkill using the extra effort as your only dice for that action.

> **Examples**<br> 
> 1. Jayse tries to tip an opponent in combat and rolls 4 Effort when he needed 2. His opponent hits the ground, and Jayse decides to use Overkill to follow up with an elbow drop. He rolls the 2 extra dice for a free attack.
> 2. Lem is trying to hack a corporate mainframe. They make a check and get 6 Effort when they only needed three; Lem is in, but they still need to find the files they need in a hurry before they're detected. Lem claims Overkill, and applies the additional Effort as bonus dice to his Hacking check to find the needed files.
