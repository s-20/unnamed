# Dice Types

The unnamed System uses a simple shorthand to tell you how your dice will work in a given roll. Most of the time, you're just rolling dice, or Normal Dice. For these rolls, you count any result of 5 or 6 as a success. The other dice are outlined below.

## Drama Dice

[Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) are fully described in their own article. Drama Dice are a special pool of dice shared by the players and used to make modifications to checks, to add or change the scene in some way, and for other purposes.

## Stunt Dice

Stunt Dice are free extra dice granted for cool descriptions. If someone comes up with an especially clever idea, describes a really cool move in combat, or does something else creative, any player can grant them a Stunt Die for the check. Players only have one stunt die per session to assign, however, and they cannot assign them to their own characters.

## Free Dice

Free dice are bonus dice a GM can grant to a check as a special bonus. Free Dice are normal dice. The GM can give them out for any reason, but beneficial circumstances or cool ideas are an excellent reason to do so.

## Perk Dice

One of the ways players can spend [Perks](Perks.md) is on extra dice. Only one Perk Die may be added to a given roll, but adding a Perk Die to the roll makes it and all the other dice in the pool into Easy Dice, and the Half Dice modifier is removed completely.
