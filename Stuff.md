# Stuff

Stuff represents things your character has in their possession. Like some other things in unnamed, Stuff can be listed specifically or more broadly defined.

It's generally assumed that you have what you need to be effective with your [Aspects](Aspects.md) and [SKills](Skills.md) as they apply to your character, within reason. A few examples:

- **Badass Hacker**: you probably have a laptop or other portable computer you've customized for your own use, and if you have a base of operations, you'll also have a full workstation, including multiple screens and boxes with great procs and lots of ram. Where all this came from is up to you. You'll also have some cash and some crypto, but unless you're rich somewhere on your sheet, not a lot. You'll also have a few gadgets to do things like hack ATMs or magnetic strips, an RF Reader, and who knows what else.
- **Private Investigator**: You've got a trench coat and fedora, of course. Camera equipment, some sort of small blunt melee weapon (a baton, brass knuckles, some ball bearings in a sock, etc.), and maybe a gun. You also probably have an office that may be equipped with a secretary (although that would require a [Connection](Connections.md)) but almost certainly has a land line and a door that's at least half glass with the name of your agency on it. You'll also have any licensing or certification you need to do your job with at least a veneer of legitimacy.
- **Great Warrior**: You've got your primary weapon (probably a sword), along with a few backups. You've got the sort of armor that goes with your chosen fighting style as well, along with everything you need to maintain your equipment. If you have a based of operations, it will be decked out with armor stands, a place to practice, and maybe a small forge.

The point is that everything that it makes sense for your character to have given the setting and [Parmeters](Parameters.md) of the game, you have.

Stuff comes in two basic types: Carried and Property. Money can be either of these, or both; basically, it depends on *how much money* we're talking about.

## Carried Stuff

Carried stuff is all the things that you probably carry on you whenever you go out the door with the intention of doing what you do. A Warrior never leaves without their sword, a Thief without their lock picks, or a Peeping Tom without their binoculars.

Note carried stuff on your character sheet. After that, you only need to note when you *don't* have something you might need; if you ran out the door in a hurry and left your gun in the safe, for instance.

As long as you've got it carried, you can pull it into a check. Stuff doesn't usually add dice, it just lets you do things you can't do without it. You can't stab someone without your knife, for instance. You can also improvise this sort of thing, although that might raise the difficulty of the check. Exceptional Stuff, like especially high quality tools or a magical bow, can provide [Synergy](Synergy.md) on appropriate checks.

Carried money is money you have immediate access to, on your person. It includes things like cash, valuables, and credit cards. You start with as much of this as makes sense for your character.

## Property Stuff

Property stuff represents things you can't carry with you; a car, an apartment, and a hidden base are examples. You have as much of this stuff as makes sense for your character as well.

Property also counts as money, but it's a lot harder to use; you might have to liquidate assets, get a mortgage, or call your board of directors for a line of credit. Whatever the case, note your net worth here if it's a significant aspect of your character. You can only be *really* rich if you've got it as an [Aspect](Aspects.md), [Connection](Connections.md), or, in extreme cases, a [Special Abiity](SpecialAbilities.md).
