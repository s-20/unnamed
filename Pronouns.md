# Pronouns

In this wiki, I am doing my level best to use a variety of pronouns in an attempt to be inclusive. People should use the pronouns they are comfortable with, and should be willing to use the pronouns other people prefer. This is simple courtesy.

That said, I may not have been perfect in this regard. I have endeavored to use the collective or singular "they" in rule text, and different other pronouns for specific examples when they are needed.

But according to the [Non-binary Wiki](https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Pronouns), a survey discovered 123 different pronouns, and while 90 of them were only used once in the survey, that leaves 33 different pronouns that were used by more than one person out of the 800+ participants in the survey.

I hate saying this, but it simply isn't practical to include that many pronouns in this limited wiki. If I have missed yours, I apologize. Just know that the unnamed system is intended to be inclusive and welcoming to all, and I haven't excluded anyone on purpose or with malice.

On that note, please let me know if you find something hurtful or offensive in the game. I am far from being an expert in these matters, but I'm trying to learn and be better. I can't promise to fix everything, but if something is making someone uncomfortable, I'd like to be accommodating if I can.

Thank you,
