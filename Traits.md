# Traits

Traits represent things where your character has exceptional ability. Even one stack in a Trait means you're good at it. Similarly, not having a Trait doesn't mean you're **weak** in that characteristic, just that you can't reliably pull it into your attempts at accomplishing things, or it's not something you can use well. FOr example, not having the Clever trait doesn't mean you're dumb.

Traits are divided into four groups: Physical, Mental, Social, and Meta. Certain things or checks may key into a category of Traits rather than anything more specific.

A well rounded character should have something from at least three categories, but there are no requirements.

## Physical Traits

Physical Traits represent things related to bodily fitness. Things like physical power, nimbleness, and overall health or constitution.

- **Strong**: Physical power; strong characters can lift heavier weights, carry a lot, and punch hard
- **Agile**: Balance and co-ordination. Agile characters have a good sense of balance and might have acrobatic abilities. Agility also represents fine motor control and eye-hand coordination.
- **Tough**: Physical resistance and overall endurance. Tough is the trait of athletes who need to hold out for a long time, from marathon runners to boxers
- **Healthy**: Immune response and resistance to intoxication. Healthy characters can drink a lot, seldom get sick, and are poison resistant

## Mental Traits

Mental Traits represent things related to mental health and acuteness. Things like willpower, cleverness, and creativity.

- **Clever**: Mental acuity and quickness; quick thinking and rational though are both aspects of being clever.
- **Observant**: The ability to assess and process sensory input. Both the ability to notice things and knowing what that information means.
- **Resolute**: Resolve, willpower, and mental fortitude.
- **Erudite**: Education or general ability to retain information. An Erudite character has a lot of information at their fingertips, and has an excellent recall.

## Social Traits

- **COnvincing**:
- **Intimidating**:
- **Empathic**:
- **Captivating**:

## Meta Traits

Meta Traits are unusual traits that represent things we can often see in people, but can't really put down to some aspect of character or direct ability. Meta Traits are for things like Luck or good timing.

Meta Traits all use special rules. For example, although you can add Lucky to pretty much any check, you have to Burn it to do so. Not all Meta Traits will be available in every game; this should be established when you outline [Parameters](Parameters.md) for the game.

See [Meta Traits](MetaTraits.md) for more specifics.

- **Lucky**: You are just lucky sometimes, although your luck occasionally turns against you
- **Daredevil**: You perform well when you are actually in danger
- **Genre Savvy**: You know all the signs to tell you what genre of "movie" you're in and what tropes will get you killed
- **Dilettante**: You know quite a few very specific things - for instance, you might not know how to drive *per se*, but you know exactly how to operate an M1 main battle tank.
