# Traits

Traits represent your character's exceptional abilities and talents. Just one rank in a Trait means you're above average at it. When you pull a Trait into a Check, you gain dice equal to the current value of the Trait. 

Similarly, not having a Trait doesn't mean you're bad at that characteristic, just that the character isn't exceptional. If you want to be actively *bad* at something, that's a [Tangle](Tangles.md). A well-rounded character should have ranks in at least three categories (see below), but there are no requirements.

Traits are divided into four categories: Physical, Mental, Social, and Meta. Certain mechanics or checks may key into a category of Traits rather than anything more specific. Generally, the GM will tell you the category of a check, and you (the player) decide how to resolve it within that category, or youâ€™ll just figure out what to use to do what you need to do.

The lists below aren't intended to be the only Traits available. If you think your character is more Wise than Clever, then use Wise instead (or in addition to). If the meaning of the trait is clear, and it isn't too broad, then it's fine.

To use a Trait, you just pull it into a check, adding dice equal to the Trait's ranks. You can normally only pull one Trait into a given check. If you want to add an additional trait, you can [Burn](Burn.md) it.

## Physical Traits

Physical Traits represent things related to bodily fitness. Things like physical power, nimbleness, and overall health or constitution.

- **Strong**: Physical power; strong characters can lift heavier weights, carry a lot, and punch hard.
- **Agile**: Gross motor control, balance and co-ordination. Agile characters have a good sense of balance and might have acrobatic abilities.
- **Dexterous**: Fine motor control and manual dexterity. The character is good with their fingers and has steady hands.
- **Tough**: Physical resistance and overall endurance. Tough is the trait of athletes who need to hold out for a long time, from marathon runners to basketball players.
- **Healthy**: Immune response and resistance to intoxication. Healthy characters can drink a lot, seldom get sick, and are poison resistant.

## Mental Traits

Mental Traits represent things related to mental health and acuteness. Things like willpower, cleverness, and creativity.

- **Clever**: Mental acuity and quickness; quick thinking and rational thought are both aspects of being clever.
- **Creative**: The ability to come up with creative solutions to problems, or to express oneself creatively. In short, the ability to think outside the box.
- **Observant**: The ability to assess and process sensory input. Both the ability to notice things and knowing what that information means.
- **Resolute**: Resolve, willpower, and mental fortitude.
- **Erudite**: Education or general ability to retain information. An Erudite character has a lot of information at their fingertips, and has an excellent recall.

## Social Traits

- **Convincing**: You are good at talking people into things. This trait is important to salespeople, politicians, and anyone in advertising.
- **Deceitful**: The ability to lie convincingly and consistently, or the ability to get people to believe things with minimal actual evidence.
- **Captivating**: You are good at making your presence known, demanding attention, and keeping the spotlight. Also useful in intimidation.
- **Empathy**: The ability to understand and relate to the emotions of others. Empathy is used to connect with others, and generally can be applied to any attempt to read people.
- **Striking**: Something about the way you look commands attention, and you know how to use that to your advantage. This might mean physical attractiveness, but it can mean knowing how to project confidence or having an intimidating bearing as well. 

## Meta Traits

Meta Traits are unusual traits that represent things we can often see in people, but can't really put down to some aspect of character or direct ability. Meta Traits are for things like Luck or good timing.

Meta Traits all use special rules. See [Meta Traits](MetaTraits.md) for more specifics.

- **Lucky**: You are just lucky sometimes, although it may occasionally turn against you
- **Daredevil**: You perform well when you are in danger
- **Genre Savvy**: You know all the signs to tell you what genre of fiction you're in and what tropes will get you killed or save your life
