# Traits

Traits represent things where your character has exceptional ability. Even one stack in a Trait means you're good at it. Similarly, not having a Trait doesn't mean you're **weak** in that characteristic, just that you can't reliably pull it into your attempts at accomplishing things, or it's not something you can use well. FOr example, not having the Smart trait doesn't mean you're dumb.

Traits are divided into six groups: Physical, Mental, Social, Sensory, and Meta. Certain things or checks may key into a category of Traits rather than anything more specific. For instance, you might be able to [Burn](Burn.md) a Physical Trait to function in a high radiation zone, or a Sensory Trait to act in a [Surprise Round](Engagement.md).

A well rounded character should have something from at least three categories, but there are no requirements.

## Physical Traits

Physical Traits represent things related to bodily fitness. Things like physical power, nimbleness, and overall health or constitution.

- **Strong**: Physical power; strong characters can lift heavier weights, carry a lot, and punch hard
- **Agile**: Balance and co-ordination. Agile characters have a good sense of balance and might have acrobatic abilities
- **Dexterous**: Eye-hand coordination and adroitness of touch. Dexterous characters are good with their hands (or tentacles or whatever) and have excellent fine motor control
- **Tough**: Physical resistance and overall endurance. Tough is the trait of athletes who need to hold out for a long time, from marathon runners to boxers
- **Healthy**: Immune response and resistance to intoxication. Healthy characters can drink a lot, seldom get sick, and are poison resistant

## Mental Traits

Mental Traits represent things related to mental health and acuteness. Things like willpower, cleverness, and creativity.

- Smart
- Determined
- Creative
- Sane
- Quick-witted

## Social Traits

- Charismatic
- Intimidating
- Empathic
- Captivating
- Attractive

## Sensory Traits

Sensory traits indicate special acuity with particular senses. All of them are phrased as "Excellent ...", as in Excellent Vision, Excellent Hearing, and so on.

Sensory Traits also cover being especially resistant to things that affect the senses. For example, "High Pain Tolerance" and "Flash Resistance" make good Sensory traits.

Unlike other Trait categories, there is no single list of Sensory traits; instead, they are player defined to suit the specific needs of their character. Sensory Traits shouldn't be too broad (like Alert), but are otherwise up to the players.

## Meta Traits

Meta Traits are unusual traits that represent things we can often see in people, but can't really put down to some aspect of character or direct ability. Meta Traits are for things like Luck or good timing.

Meta Traits all use special rules. For example, although you can add Lucky to pretty much any check, you have to Burn it to do so. Not all Meta Traits will be available in every game; this should be established when you outline [Parameters](Parameters.md) for the game.

See [Meta Traits](MetaTraits.md) for more specifics.

- **Lucky**: You are just lucky sometimes, although your luck occasionally turns against you
- **Daredevil**: You perform well when you are actually in danger
- **Genre Savvy**: You know all the signs to tell you what genre of "movie" you're in and what tropes will get you killed
- **Dilettante**: You know quite a few very specific things - for instance, you might not know how to drive *per se*, but you know exactly how to operate an M1 main battle tank.
