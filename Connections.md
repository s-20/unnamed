# Connections

Connections are a [Characteristic](Characteristics.md) that represents things that ground the character in the setting. These are things, people, organizations, places, and so on that they can count on. Connections can represent many things, but there is one common thread: they are part of the world outside the character that the character is somehow involved with.

Mechanically, Connections serve multiple purposes. They are resources that can be pulled for checks when appropriate. They also open up possible courses of action for the character, and can be related to [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md).

## Building Connections

During [character creation](CharacterCreation.md), you can use your characteristic ranks to build Connections for your character. You aren't required to take any, but most characters should have at least two Connections, and spend at least five ranks on Connections in total. Connections are player defined, drawn from their character's background. There are a few general types, but they all boil down to a phrase or sentence describing a person, organization, place, thing, or event in the world, and the player's connection to it.

During the game, you will find yourself making more ties to the world. These should be noted, but they aren't added to your character sheet as Connections unless you can reliably call upon them to help you; this typically requires you to spend [Advancements](Advancement.md), although the GM may give ranks in connections to characters as a special award.

## Burning Bridges

It is possible to lose Connections. This can happen due to story events (an NPC you're connected to dies, you get a burn notice from your spy agency, etc.), or you can Burn your Bridges.

Burning your Bridges happens when you [Burn](Burn.md) a Connection to add to a roll. Unlike other characteristics, burned Connections don't come back automatically or with rest. Sometimes a significant amount of in-game time is sufficient, but other times restoring Connections takes a bit more work. By burning a Connection, you've put a strain on the relationship. This might mean you need to buy a friend flowers, work overtime, or publish a new paper to repair your reputation with the Connection.

Unlike other Characteristics, a Connection can be burned down to 0 ranks, In doing so, you might be able to get an extra benefit from the Connection, either a “once more for old time's sake” big favor, or a “well, screw it, I'm getting fired anyway, I might as well go all out” situation. In addition to the benefits of burning the connection, you also get 2 extra [Effort](Effort.md) on the check, even if you don't roll any.

If you burn a Connection to 0, you've called in one favor too many, and the Connection is permanently gone. You might be fired, lose a friend, get disowned, or any of a variety of things. If this happens, you'll have to work to get the Connection back, if it's even possible to do so. You'll have to build the connection from scratch, and doing so will cost you Advancements.

## Connections Used Against You

Sometimes, your connections can be used against you. Having a Connection implies some degree of caring or loyalty to the Connection. The GM may use any of your Connections as a plot hook. Your friend in the DOT might get kidnapped, or someone else who belonged to your unit in the war might need a favor. 

You can ignore this sort of thing, but doing so reduces its value by one rank permanently — if word gets out that your character won't help his fraternity brothers, they won't help you either.

## Other PCs as Connections

If you have a previous relationship with another PC, or if PCs have been together for a long time in play, they may take a Connection with each other — something like Jethro and Ash fought in The War together.

You can pull this Connection when appropriate to give each other a hand. Continuing the fought in The War example, you might be able to pull the Connection to understand a quick hand sign, or to pass a coded message to one another (“This really reminds me of Helsinki”). Basically, it can be pulled for most checks involving teamwork.

## Types of Connection

Connections are roughly divided into 5 different types based on how they connect you to the world. The types are Personal, Organizational, Social, Environmental, and Temporal. Types are just for organizational purposes and to provide some inspiration; there is no mechanical difference between them.

### Personal

Personal connections are people you know. This might mean close friends, people that owe you favors, family, and so on. You don't need to take a Personal Connection for every person you know, just those that can be counted on to provide regular assistance. For example, your Mother doesn't need to be taken as a Connection unless your relationship is tight enough that you can *almost* always count on her, and she can provide access to information or resources that aren't generally available.

Just because you don't have an “official” connection with someone doesn't mean you can't ask them for favors. Your mother might be willing to let you stay at her house for a few days even if you don't have the Connection listed on your character sheet, but she probably won't do it no questions asked, or without consequence.

**Examples**:

- My Mother, who is a retired police officer and has maintained contact with her informants
- My old Gaming Group from High School — Jamie, Kelly, Sam, and Bobby — who would take a bullet for me
- My kooky rich Uncle Jed, who's clearly got a screw loose and more money than he knows what to do with

### Organizational

These Connections represent organizations you belong to. An Organizational Connection might mean membership in a club or secret society (you're a Mason!), your place of employment (you're a police officer working for Chicago PD), or anything similar.

**Examples**:

- I'm a cop working for Mars Station PD
- I'm a soldier in the King's army
- I belong to the Skull Society

### Social

Social Connections are things that affect your placement in society, like titles, special statuses, or social groups. These things only count as a Connection if you can reliably use them to help you or will otherwise impact the game in some way. If belonging to the group (or whatever) is generally a disadvantage, then it might be a [Tangle](Tangles.md) as well.

**Examples**:

- I am an actress who's famous for being a B movie scream-queen
- I am the Duke of Eddleton and a member of the House of Lords
- I am in the Highborn Caste, and am treated with respect because of it
- I'm an honorably discharged Army veteran

### Environmental

Environmental Connections are places you are very familiar with. This might mean where you grew up, or a region you've traveled extensively. Environmental Connections grant you geographic and cultural familiarity, and can explain why you can speak a particular language.

**Examples**:

- I've been hiking the Appalachian Trail since I was 12
- I've been traveling across Southeast Asia for more than a decade
- I've spent a lot of time in deserts, and am comfortable in these environments
- I'm a Chicago native; I know the place like the back of my hand and have my finger on the pulse of the social scene

### Temporal (Events)

A Temporal Connection means that you were in a particular place at a particular time, and you participated in some way. This forges a connection with everyone else who was there, and, depending on the event, can bring respect, fear, or even animosity with others.

**Examples**:

- I stormed the beaches at Normandy on D-Day
- I was held hostage by the Seventh Dawn during the Corporate Wars
- I was present and helped others when Hurricane Margaret hit Galveston
