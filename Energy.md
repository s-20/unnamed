# Energy

Energy represent a resource used to power a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md) in the unnamed System. Energy isn't strictly required, but can be used to add flavor, to keep things within campaign [Parameters](Parameters.md), or to help balanc e out very flexible or powerful [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md).

Energy comes in many forms, and should be named individually depending on how it is used for consistency in a given setting. For example, if you decide that holiness and avoiding taboos allows you to increase your mystical power, and that power is only lost through taboos, then you could call that Energy source Manna, and later characters or NPCs that use the same sort of abilities could follow the same rules.

Like [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), Energy should be tailored to the given campaign or even to the specific character. Below are several examples of different Energy pools and how to implement them. These should be used as inspiration, and altered at will.

## Static Pool (Majika, Magic Points)

A Static Pool represents a sort of Spell-Point system - each use of the [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) depending on how powerful the effect is. Once you run out of a Static Pool, you're done using the [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) until you can recharge the pool in some way.

Static pools are more fun if they're large, and since they're difficult to replenish (see below), it's fair to make them fair sized. 20 is a good staring point, adding 2 for every stack in an appropriate [Skill](Skills.md) and 5 for an appropriate [Talent](Skills.md) and every stack in a related [Aspect](Aspects.md).

### Recharging the Pool

When you establish the Static Pool, you also have to establish a way to recharge it. This usually comes in the form or meditation or study for magic, but can also mean recharging batteries, gathering components, getting more ammunition, or whatever else makes sense.

The main thing is that recharging the pool isn't *trivial*. It takes time, effort, and/or expense, and cannot be done the moment an encounter is over. Generally, you at least have to wait until the end of a scene, but you might have to wait until the end of an in-game day or longer.

## Building Pool (Technique, Combat Tech)

A Building Pool builds up by doing something else - making attacks in combat, taking damage, casting spells, or what have you. You can spend from the pool to activate an ability at any time, provided you have enough in the pool.

While a Static Pool is difficult to fill, a Building Pool is difficult to keep. You generally lose all of your Building Pool at the end og an encounter or a scene, depending on the nature of the ability.

Building Pools are good for simulating the sort of Combos sometimes found in MMORPGS, or for abilities related to combat techniques or long rituals that you have to charge up to use.

## Discipline (Divinity, Honor, Manna)

A Discipline pool isn't spent like a Static or Building pool. Instead, it is maintained through actions (rituals, prayer, holy deeds, performing sacraments, maintaining honor, etc.) at a particular level, and as long as it stays at that level, you have access to related abilities.

If through particularly pious or honorable action (or whatever), you raise your Discipline pool above its normal level, you may gain access to new abilities, or your existing abilities may become more powerful. Going against the teachings of your deity or being dishonored, on the other hand, will cause you to lose discipline. Once your level goes below its normal level, you cannot use your abilities at all until you atone or otherwise redeem yourself.

Although Discipline is described as "honor" or "piety" above, it can be applied to any complex or ritualistic code of conduct. It can represent gaining and keeping Mojo or Manna by performing rites to appease spirits and avoiding taboos, for instance.

## Serendipity (Pure luck)

Not exactly an energy pool, Serendipity activates an ability when certain random conditions are met. The easiest way to handle is is to specify something along the lines of "Whenever I roll triples", or "If I roll 1, 2, 3 and still get at least 1 Success."

Any random mechanic can be used, however - you could, for instance, assign different abilities to different cards in a deck, and draw them to use the ability, with whichever card you drew being the effect you produce that round, or that scene. Some, or even most, of the cards should do nothing, produce useless effects, or be deleterious, however - unless, of course, your luck is always good.

## Breaking Point (Limit Break)

A Breaking Point energy pool builds up as you are hit or affected in a fight, and once it reaches a certain threshold, you spend it all on a single massive effect. You can have multiple different effects with different thresholds, if you like, or add more as you gain in experience. However, whichever ability you trigger, the whole of your Breaking Point energy is depleted.

Unlike a Building Pool (above), Breaking Points don't automatically empty at the end of an encounter or scene. Instead, as long as your remain injured, the Breaking Point pool remains.

This can be used to emulate the "limit break" attacks that are popular in Anime and certain RPGs.
