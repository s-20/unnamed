# Energy

Energy is a resource used to power a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md) or some sort of special action in the unnamed System. Energy is optional, and is a sub-characteristic of Special Abilities.

Energy comes in many forms, and should be named individually depending on how it is used for consistency in a given setting. For example, if you decide that holiness and avoiding taboos allows you to increase your mystical power, and that power is only lost through taboos, then you could call that Energy source Manna, and later characters or NPCs that use the same sort of abilities could follow the same rules.

Like [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), Energy should be tailored to the given campaign or even to the specific character. One Special Ability can use different Energy Pools for different effects. Some Energy Pools are Dynamic (their totals go up and down as they are used), some are progressive (they scale up or down based on something other than use), and some are static (you have as much as you have, improving only through [Advancement](Advancement.md)). Here are a few example Energy Pools, with suggestions on how to implement them.

## Magic Points

Magic Points are a pool used to create discrete effects from a list of available options or "spells". A "Spell" list can be a predefined list of known effects or it can be tied to more generalized abilities or [Skills](Skills.md). Magic Points are expended to create the effects. Most of the time, Spells require time as well - one or more Actions in [Combat](Combat.md) or some brief period of time out of combat. Magic Points are replenished either through rest or ritual.

The way Magic Points work will vary from setting to setting, so you should outline any special rules you have, How Magic Points are replenished is an important thing to consider, It can be renewed completely at sunrise, after meditation, through potions, by drinking the blood of the innocent, or whatever makes sense for the setting. How powerful and dynamic Spells are is equally important. Renaming Magic Points to something more setting specific and flavorful can add a lot as well.

Magic Point pools tend to be high, allowing for flexibility in the power of effects (a 1 point spell and a 10 point spell might have vastly different power levels). The pool could be based on a [Trait](Trait.md) or Skill (10x your ranks of Resolute or Lore-Magic), or it could be a flat value improved through Advancements (starts at 10, +1 per Advancement). How much spells cost can vary, but a guideline for damaging effects is at least 5 points to create an effect that can deal out Wounds. Other effects can scale as well.

### Corruption

The opposite of Magic Points, a Corruption Energy Pool might grow as you use it, leading to side effects ranging from [Conditions](Conditions.md) to roleplay consequences to physical alterations or whatever you like. The point is that as your Corruption increases, bad things start to happen. Corruption generally has a threshold of some kind. After you reach this level of corruption, effects might become significantly worse, permanent, life-threatening, or ther emight be some event horizon after which there's no turning back - you're lost to evil, madness, the dark side, or whatever fits.

Before you reach the Threshold, there may or may not be a way to reduce your corruption. Therapy, cleansing rituals, performing virtuous acts, drinking potions, spending Advancements, or other things might reduce your corruption. In general, it should be harder to remove corruption than it is to regain Magic Points. You might be able to use Advancements to increase the threshold, or it might be set at a permanent level.

## Momentum

Momentum is a groping pool that can be used in several ways. As a specific event occurs, the Momentum increases, providing more and more dice for whatever it is used to power, and sometimes unlocking new possible actions along the way. Momentum can grow every round of Combat, making things progressively more and more dangerous, for instance.

Generally, Momentum isn't spent, it just unlocks more and more abilities or adds to a dice pool. For instance, a character might need time to really get going, gaining 1 Momentum each round of combat, allowing them to use their most impressive abilities only once they've really gotten into the zone. Alternately, Momentum could be a universal thing, adding dice to all checks equal to its value.

Momentum generally resets to 0 at the end of a scene, combat, or campaign arc.

### Limit

Limit builds like Momentum until it reaches a certain point, and can then be unleashed, after which it is reset to 0 and starts to build again. Limit can grow when you get hit, when you roll a certain level of [Effort](Effort.md), or anything else you can think of. Once your Limit is maximized (reaches an arbitrary value, like 10, that you might be able to reduce with Advancements), you use it all at once for something big defined by your SPecial Ability or the campaign [Parameters](Parameters.md).

## Scale

Scale could represent how powerful a character's "super powers" are as a flat value. It is generally a set value that doesn't change much, except as part of a plot point or perhaps with Advancements. In comics, a super hero's powers might change or add more applications, but they only grow in actual power very slowly.

Scale can be tied into Traits or Skills, indicating that they're superhuman and operate on a different scale - you get 1 free Effort per Scale when using that Trait, or 2 if you Burn the Trait, for instance. Alternately, it might provide a dice pool for energy blasts or define the maximum potential for "super magic" that works like Magic Point magic, except the Scale doesn't change when you use it (think Doctor Strange).

Scale doesn't change with use, but new uses can  be applied through [Stunts](Stunts.md) or learning a new Focus or Skill. Special events in a game might temporarily boost or suppress a character's Scale as well.
