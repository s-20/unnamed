# student 20 Unnamed RPG Project

This wiki is primarily the in-progress development page for the Tabletop RPG (TTRPG) I'm working on. It doesn't have a name yet, so the working title is Unnamed RPG. You can find it right here:

**[Unnamed RPG Project](system/HBCore.md)**

## Base Concepts

The game is intended to be universal, with scaling for "special abilities" like magic or superpowers. Although the resolution system allows for absolute failure, it is focused on failing-forward with partial failure and partial success both more likely that straight-out failure.

The system works by accessing or "pulling" different characteristics to build a dice pool of d6s and sometimes d8s. When rolled, any result of 5+ is a success, and any result of 7+ "bounces"; meanwhile, any result of 1 is a Failure. Failures and Successes cancel each other out.

- If all the dice are Failures, it's a disaster.
- If you have some Failures, but some not-failures, you just fail.
- If you have no failures but not successes either, you partially fail, but you still move towards your goal.
- One success means a partial success; you complete your task, but there's a twist.
- 2+ successes means complete success; the more successes the better.

## Other Stuff

There's other stuff I've worked on (and am working on) hosted here! CHeck this stuff out, if you're interested.
