# Character Creation Summary

To create a character:

1. **Character Concept and Aspects**: Come up with and discuss your character concept during [Session Zero](SessionZero.md). Select two different [Aspects](Aspects.md) related to this concept.
2. **Baseline Characteristics**: Distribute 15 ranks between [Traits](Traits.md), [Skills](Skills.md), and [Connections](Connections.md). You cannot have more than a [Stack](Stack.md) of 3 in any one [Characteristic](Characteristic.md) at this point, and you must spend at least 3 ranks in Traits. If you have a Stack of 3 in a Skill, select a free [Focus](Foci.md).
3. **Special Abilities**: If your campaign has them, you should discuss your [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) with the GM and the other players. Each Special Ability is defined individually, so work together to make something everyone will enjoy having in the game.
4. **Tangles (optional)**: Add [Tangles](Tangles.md) to the character.
