# Character Creation Summary

To create a character:

1. **Character Concept and Origin**: Come up with and discuss your character concept during [Session Zero](SessionZero.md). Determine your character's [Origin](Origin.md) now.
2. **Aspects**: Take Five [Aspects](Aspects.md) that help define your character in a broad sense. You can take the same Aspect more than once, but you must have at least two different Aspects.
3. **Traits**: Select 10 [Traits](Traits.md) that reflect your characters individual strengths; you can increase a Trait's [Stack](Stack.md) up to 5.
4. **Talents and Skills**: Select 2 Talents and spend 15 [Skill](Skills.md) Points to buy stacks in Skills and Foci.
5. **Connections**: Establish at least 4 different Connections using 10 Connection Points; if you can share a connection with or have a connection to another player's character, so much the better. Connections cannot start with a [Stack](Stack.md) above 5.
6. **Special Abilities**: If your campaign has them, you should discuss your [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md) with the GM and the other players. Each Special Ability is defined individually, so work together to make something everyone will enjoy having in the game.
7. **Details**: Select several [Details](Details.md) to round out your character. You should take at least 3, and can have as many as five. Details do not stack.
8. **Complications**: Optionally, you may add [Complications](Complications.md) to the character. Although not required, these provide opportunities to gain [Perks](Perks.md), [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md), and bonus [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md).
9.  **Final Notes** - *Before Session 1*: Finalize your character's background and expand on it as far as you'd like; make sure you share it with the GM. It doesn't have to be a novel - a paragraph or two is plenty. Tell players whose characters have connections to your character stuff they should know about your character. Make sure you haven't forgotten anything. Have fun!
