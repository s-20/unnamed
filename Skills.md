# Skills

Skills represent stuff a character knows how to do which typically requires training, education, or both. If your character is a musician, a scientist, an artist, or an occultist, it will be reflected in their skills.

Skills are used in much the same way [Traits](Traits.md) are - when you pull them for a check, you roll 1d6 for each stack in the skill. Unlike Traits, however, you cannot [Burn](Burn.md) skills.

## Skill Focuses

A Focus is a specific area of expertise within a broader skill. Whenever you learn a new Skill, you also select a Focus. You can add additional Focuses with [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md).

You are considered generally skilled in the whole of the Skill, but your area of expertise is represented by your focus. When working within your Focus, you gain an additional die when you pull the skill.

In addition, some of the [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md)  mechanics hook into Focuses.

## Specialties

A Specialty is a very narrow part of a skill that you are particularly well versed. So if a character has the Trade (Lawyer) skill, they might have a Maritime Law Specialty. Specialties are player defined, and they should be a much more narrow branch of a Skill Focus the character already has.

When you pull a Skill for a check that falls within the Specialty, the successes for those dice are doubled.

A character can only have one Specialty per skill. Specialties are purchased with [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md) at a rate of 2 each.

## Skill List

The skills listed below are (hopefully) comprehensive. The individual Focuses for the skills may shift between campaigns based on your established [Parameters](Parameters.md). The Focus lists are not intended to be comprehensive, either, merely to indicate the scope of foci.

There will probably eventually be a comprehensive list of foci for each skill; until then, use the ones listed below or make up something similar.
