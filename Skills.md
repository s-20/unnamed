# Skills
Skills are [Characteristics](Characteristics.md) that represent things your character knows how to do. Skills have two levels - the Skill itself, representing a broadly applicable area of knowledge or talent, and a Focus, representing a narrow area of specialization or expertise.

During Character Creation, ranks in skills are selected as normal Characteristics. You cannot usually start with more than 3 ranks in most skills, although you can go up to 4 ranks with one skill, or up to five ranks in one skill if you don’t go over 1 rank in any other skill. See [Character Creation](CharacterCreation.md) for more details.

## Creating Skills
You create a skill by combining an Adjective or Verb (what you can do) and a Noun (what you can do it to). For example, if you want to be able to pilot aircraft, you would take Operate (adjective) and Aircraft (noun). You can use any Adjective/Verb and Noun combination you’d like, provided it isn’t too broad. 

Some suggestions are provided in the table below - take an Adjective from the first column and combine it with a Noun from the second. This list is a good baseline; you should see if  you can’t build what you want from this list first before branching out and making your own, although specific genre will have their own additions or replacements for things here.
