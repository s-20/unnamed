# Skills
Skills are [Characteristics](Characteristics.md) that represent things your character knows how to do. Skills have two levels - the Skill itself, representing a broadly applicable area of knowledge or talent, and a Focus, representing a narrow area of specialization or expertise.

During Character Creation, ranks in skills are selected as normal Characteristics. You cannot usually start with more than 3 ranks in most skills, although you can go up to 4 ranks with one skill, or up to five ranks in one skill if you don’t go over 1 rank in any other skill. See [Character Creation](CharacterCreation.md) for more details.

## Creating Skills
You create a skill by combining an Adjective or Verb (what you can do) and a Noun (what you can do it to). For example, if you want to be able to pilot aircraft, you would take Operate (adjective) and Aircraft (noun). You can use any Adjective/Verb and Noun combination you’d like, provided it isn’t too broad. 

### Adjectives and Verbs

The first word in a Skill is either an Adjective or a Verb, and describes what the skill *does*. So a skill that started with Close would be usable on things nearby, Know means you have a significant amount of information at your disposal, and Create or Craft mean you know how to make something.

The following list is not exhaustive - you can add to it as appropriate to your game or character, but these should cover a lot of ground, so try to stick to them if you can:

- Close
- Craft/Create
- Distant

## Focus

A Focus is a specific area where your knowledge of a skill is especially in depth. You can think of it as a focused area of study, a specialization, or a particular talent. Unlike a Skill, a Focus is neither pulled nor burned. Instead, you can claim [Synergy](Synergy.md) whenever the Focus applies.

Foci are player-defined, but they should be explainable in a single sentence, and should indicate a much more specific aspect of the related skill. For example, if you have the skill Operate-Computers, with a focus on Hacking, you could claim Synergy any time you were trying to break into someone’s Facebook account or take down the FBI’s website, but you wouldn’t get SYnergy when using a computer for anything else, like doing web research, programming, or repairing your borked Endeavor OS install.

A Focus can also be motivational instead of skill oriented. For instance, you could have Close-Combat (Defending my Honor), and claim Synergy when fighting to restore face or avenge an insult. In fact, a Focus can be just about anything you can think of, as long as it represents a significantly smaller subset of use cases. During the Full Moon, During the First Round of Combat, or When Wounded are all situational options, for instance.

You gain a free Focus with your second rank in a Skill. You can take additional Foci for a single skill at hte same cost as buying a rank in a skill. You can’t usually have more than three Foci for any single skill, however.
