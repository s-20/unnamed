# Skills
Skills are [Characteristics](Characteristics.md) that represent things your character knows how to do. Skills have two tiers of specificity - the Skill itself, representing a broadly applicable area of knowledge or talent, and a Focus, representing a narrow area of specialization or expertise.

During Character Creation, ranks in skills are selected as normal Characteristics. You cannot start with more than 3 ranks in a skill. If you have two or more ranks in a Skill, you gain one free Focus, and can take additional focuses at a cost of 1 per Characteristic Point (or 1 per [Advancement](Advancement.md)).

## Skill List

Skills can be chosen from the list below. Hopefully, this table will cover most circumstances. If you need additional skills, or you want one that isn't covered below, make sure what you're adding isn't a [Trait](Traits.md), but otherwise have at it!

>> Add a note about making up the skills you need

*Descriptions to be added later; hopefully, you get the idea form the names lol*

| **Skill Name** | *Description* |
| --- | --- |
| Athletics |  |
| Conversation |  |
| Combat (Close) |  |
| Combat (Distant) |  |
| History |  |
| Investigate |  |
| Lore |  |
| Nature |  |
| Science |  |
| Streetwise |  |
| Subterfuge |  |
| Technology |  |

You can add skills like Magic and Psionics if your setting needs them, although they might be better handled with a Focus, depending on the situation.

### Dilettante

Dilettante is a special Skill that reflects having a lot of little experiences across a life of travel, leisure, and adventure. Dilettante allows you to play a Jack-Of-All-Trades sort whose life and experiences has given them some insight into most situations, but no real mastery of any particular skill. You still have other Skills, since there are things you're properly good at, after all.

Dilettante can only be [Burned](Burn.md), and when it is it provides dice as though you had pulled it into the check instead. It can't be used in conjunction with another Skill, and cannot gain a Focus. It can be used in place of any Skill in a check, and you can describe a circumstance in your well-traveled past where you encountered this exact situation (or at least something similar enough to apply).

## Focus

A Focus is a specific area where your knowledge of a skill is especially in depth. You can think of it as a focused area of study, a specialization, or a particular talent. Unlike a Skill, a Focus is neither pulled nor burned. Instead, you gain [Synergy](Synergy.md) whenever the Focus applies, and a [Drama Die](DramaDice.md) is added if you make a check involving a Focus and don't beat the [Difficulty](Challenge.md) on the check.

Focuses are player-defined, but they should be explainable in a single sentence, and should indicate a much more specific aspect of the related skill. For example, if you have the skill Technology, with a focus on Hacking, you would claim Synergy any time you were trying to break into someone’s Facebook account or take down the FBI’s website, but you wouldn’t get Synergy when using a computer for anything else, like doing web research, programming, or repairing your borked Endeavor OS install.

A Focus can also be motivational instead of skill oriented. For instance, you could have Combat (CLose) (Defending my Honor), and claim Synergy when fighting to restore face or avenge an insult. In fact, a Focus can be just about anything you can think of, as long as it represents a more precise subset of use cases. During the Full Moon, During the First Round of Combat, or When Wounded are all situational options, for instance.

You gain a free Focus with your second rank in a Skill. Additional Focuses can be purchased with a single Characteristic Point during character creation, or for 1 Advancement after the game starts.

## Alternate Skill System (old)

This is the original unnamed Skill system, which operated by putting an Adjective and a Noun together to describe a skill. It's here partly because I haven't given up on ait yet and partly because I think, if nothing else. it's interesting. In any case, in a given game you should probably use one or the other.

### Creating Skills
You create a skill by combining an Adjective or Verb (what you can do) and a Noun (what you can do it to). For example, if you want to be able to pilot aircraft, you would take Operate (adjective) and Aircraft (noun). You can use any Adjective/Verb and Noun combination you’d like, provided it isn’t too broad.

#### Adjectives

The first word in a Skill is an Adjective, and describes what the skill *does*. So a skill that started with Linguistic would be related to languages and the study thereof, and Famous could involve things that are well known to many, although “well known to everyone” and “well known to D&D Gamers” both involve fame.

The following list is not exhaustive; you can add to it as appropriate to your game or character.

- Careful
- Collective
- Covert
- Create
- Distant
- Explosive
- Famous
- Forceful
- Historical
- Knowledgeable
- Linguistic
- Martial
- Natural
- Close
- Observant
- Obscure
- Occult
- Operate
- Religious
- Scientific
- Technological
- Unarmed

#### Nouns

Nouns represent *what the skill applies to*, and is the second word in the skill name. So skills with the Sabotage noun would involve breaking things, and skills with the Combat noun are probably useful in, well, [Combat](Combat.md).

This list isn’t exhaustive, and can be expanded to include setting-specific things or any other noun that covers something you want, but isn’t here.

- Animal
- Art
- Archaic Weapons
- Assassination
- Combat
- Computer
- Deception
- Engineering
- Firearms
- Knowledge
- Lore
- Melee Weapons
- Negotiation
- Pilot
- Psychology
- Plant
- Relationships
- Repairs
- Research
- Sabotage
- Science
- Security
- Sense
- Technology
- Theft
- Vehicle

#### Sample Skills

- **Careful-Deception**: You are skilled at lying or otherwise misleading - without getting caught.
- **Covert-Research**: You are skilled at doing research without others knowing what you’re up to, or are skilled at doing research into covert ops or other such things, or both.
- **Occult-Sabotage**: You can either break stuff through occult means, or you can disrupt occult actions, etc.
- **Martial-Art**: You can look at this as meaning skill in *literal* Martial Arts (Pankration, MMA, Wu Shu, etc.), or a skill in military or combative artistry.
- **Scientific-Assassination**: The use of sciencey stuff to kill people, or knowing how to destroy the reputation of a scientist or science-based organization or theory. In fairness, if you know how to do one, you probably also know how to do the other.
- **Linguistic-Lore**: You know a lot about languages, and probably speak more than a few.

### Focus

A Focus is a specific area where your knowledge of a skill is especially in depth. You can think of it as a focused area of study, a specialization, or a particular talent. Unlike a Skill, a Focus is neither pulled nor burned. Instead, you gain [Synergy](Synergy.md) whenever the Focus applies, and a [Drama Die](DramaDice.md) is added if you make a check involving a Focus and don't beat the [Difficulty](Challenge.md) on the check.

Focuses are player-defined, but they should be explainable in a single sentence, and should indicate a much more specific aspect of the related skill. For example, if you have the skill Operate-Computers, with a focus on Hacking, you would claim Synergy any time you were trying to break into someone’s Facebook account or take down the FBI’s website, but you wouldn’t get Synergy when using a computer for anything else, like doing web research, programming, or repairing your borked Endeavor OS install.

A Focus can also be motivational instead of skill oriented. For instance, you could have Close-Combat (Defending my Honor), and claim Synergy when fighting to restore face or avenge an insult. In fact, a Focus can be just about anything you can think of, as long as it represents a more precise subset of use cases. During the Full Moon, During the First Round of Combat, or When Wounded are all situational options, for instance.

You gain a free Focus with your second rank in a Skill. You can gain additional Focuses for a skill through [Advancement](Advancement.md), but there is usually a limit of 3 Focuses to a single Skill.

## Dilettante

Dilettante is a special Skill that reflects having a lot of little experiences across a life of travel, leisure, and adventure. Dilettante allows you to play a Jack-Of-All-Trades sort whose life and experiences has given them some insight into most situations, but no real mastery of any particular skill. You still have other Skills, since there are things you're properly good at, after all.

Dilettante can only be [Burned](Burn.md), and when it is it provides dice as though you had pulled it into the check instead. It can't be used in conjunction with another Skill, and cannot gain a Focus. It can be used in place of any Skill in a check, and you can describe a circumstance in your well-traveled past where you encountered this exact situation (or at least something similar enough to apply).
