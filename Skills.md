# The Skill System: Talents, Skills, and Foci

The unnamed System uses three levels of precision when dealing with things a character knows how to do:

- **Talents**: Broad areas of expertise where a character has natural ability or a broad base of information; you're just a bit better at all of these things than most people.
- **Skills**: Narrower areas of training. Where Talents may represent natural ability, Skills (almost) always represent specific training, education, and/or practice.
- **Focus**: Very specific things that a character knows about or knows how to do; they can be pulled like Skills, even for a check with the Skill they're attached to. Foci cannot provide [Synergy](Synergy.md), however.

Each level of precision is selected individually during character creation. You can have a Skill you don't have a Talent for, and even a Focus without an associated Skill or Talent.

Talents, SKills, and Foci are pulled for checks just like [Traits](Traits.md), except that they can't be [Burned](Burn.md) for extra effort (but see the *[Burned Out Condition](Conditions.md)*). You may be able to burn them for a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md) cost, however.

## Talents

Talents represent broad areas of natural ability or training. Talents are valuable and provide a big advantage in a broad area, but characters normally only have two different Talents.

Talents don't have a [Stack](Stack.md), and don't provide dice when they're pulled for a check. Talents don't represent expertise; instead, if a character is talented, things of that sort are just *easier* for them. All dice for the associated check are one step easier (see [Dice Types](DiceTypes.md)).

You may only pull one Talent into a given check, even if you have more than one Talent that could apply. Unlike many other Characteristics, Talents cannot be [Burned](Burn.md).

### Starting Characters - Talents

New characters start with two Talents. You can trade one or both of these starting Talents for 5 Skills each. Gaining new Talents is difficult; see [Advancement](Advancement.md) for more details.

### Talent List

The following list isn't exhaustive, and is designed to be used in almost any game, regardless of genre. Different genre or individual games might need more Talents; this should be established when you set up a campaign's [Parameters](Parameters.md).

| **Talent** | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Athletics** | The character is athletically inclined. How this manifests is largely up to you, but the character probably enjoys participating in physical activities like sports, running, swimming, and so on. This Talent can be pulled for things involving physical fitness or prowess - jumping, climbing, etc. - that are not directly attacking someone or defending one's self in combat. |
| **Charisma** | The character is talented in social situations, and tends to leave an impression wherever they go. Charisma can be pulled for most social checks that involve direct interaction. |
| **Combat, Close** | Close Combat represents an ability to handle oneself when close to enemies. This means things like boxing, martial arts, and most melee weapons, but it also means using a gun at point blank range and properly wearing and using armor. |
| **Combat, Distant** | Distant Combat represents attacking things from  more than 10 feet away, regardless of how you do it. It also involves things like dodging missiles, properly using cover, and providing covering fire. |
| **Erudition** | This represents a talent for education, research, and other liberal arts interests. History, languages, memorization, and culture all fall under this category. Erudite individuals usually have a higher education of some sort, although some are autodidacts. |
| **Expression** | This represents artistic talent and the ability to effectively express one's self. Expression includes things like paining or other visual arts, dance, writing, oratory, debate, and so on. |
| **Lore** | This talent represents a breadth of knowledge about a variety of subjects that aren't easily categorized in other areas. Lore is for things like folklore, religion, local knowledge (the layout and hotspots of a particular city, for instance), and so on. Depending on your [Parameters](Parameters.md), you may want to divide this Talent into, for instance, Lore (Planes), Lore (Folklore), Lore (City Name), and so on. |
| **Nature** | Nature is all about... well, nature. The world outside of sentient/sapient creatures is the natural world. Nature covers things like dealing with animals, wilderness survival, and navigation. It's all about how you interact with the natural world. |
| **Obfuscation** | Obfuscation is a talent for hiding things from notice or being deceptive or surreptitious. Bluffs, most things involving thievery, stealth, and camouflage all fall within this Talent. |
| **Occult** | Occult is a talent with Things Man Wasn't Meant To Know. Occult is about magic, demons, monsters, psychic ability, and forbidden lore. It also covers a knowledge of cults and their practices. Occult is a talent for all things supernatural as well.
| **Resolve** | Force of will and integrity. Resolve is a talent for keeping going no matter what, and for sticking to your beliefs, resisting coercion, and otherwise standing your ground. |
| **Science** |A Talent with science means an intuitive understanding of scientific thought process and methodology. It also includes general science knowledge. |
| **Technology** | This represents a talent with machines, devices, and other similar things. It includes computers and electronics in a modern setting. Technology applies to operation, engineering, repair, and any other clear application to all things mechanical, electronic, or similar. In some settings, this may include things like cybernetics or even genetics! |
| **Trade (Profession)** | Trade represents skills used for making a living. THis includes professions, crafts, and labor work. It is a very broad talent, and dependong on your [Parameters](Parameters.md), you may wish to divide it up into things like Trade (Buisiness), Trade (Crafting), or Trade (Sex Work). |
| **Trivia** | Trivia is a special Talent that has no associated skills. When making a "knowledge" check (that is, a check to see if you know something), you can pull Trivia into any check that you don't have a skill for. This will either make the dice for the check one step easier as usual for a Talent, or it may make it possible for you to make the check at all, depending on how obscure the information is. |

## Skills

Skills are specific areas of training. Normally, having a skill means you have practiced at something, gone to school for it, or have otherwise directed effort at getting better at it.

Skills [Stack](Stack.md) normally, and provide dice when pulled for a check. You can usually only pull one Skill per check; if you have another skill that might be helpful, though, you can claim [Synergy](Synergy.md), which will give you an additional die. The most appropriate Skill provides the dice, not the one with the highest stack.

Skills are all associated with a particular Talent. You don't need to take the talent in order to put ranks in the skill, but having the talent will almost always make the skill more effective.

The skills listed below aren't exhaustive. They merely represent the most common skills for most games. You might have additional Skills for [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), or if you don't see what you're looking for here, you can just make one up.

### Skill List

Skills are divided into Talent Groups. Nearly every time you pull a Skill, you will also be able to pull the associated Talent if you have it.

### Custom Skills

As previously mentioned, the skill list above isn't exhaustive. You might want something different for any of a number of reasons. A given Setting might have skills that others don't. Some [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) use custom skills as well. Or maybe you just don't like what's listed and want something different.

Whatever the case, making a new skill is simple enough. Using the above list as a guideline, just name a new Skill. The Skill needs an associated Talent, and should be about as specific as the ones listed above.

Sometimes it's as simple as renaming a skill to something else. Don't like Acrobatics? How about Gymnastics or Tumbling instead? Don't like Subterfuge? How about Deceit? As long as it's a synonym, it's probably okay. Just make sure everyone knows what's going on - someone else might prefer Gymnastics as well! Because the unnamed System leaves a lot of things up to individual interpretation, however, changes like this can have an effect on the mechanics of the game.

### Starting Characters - Skills

Starting characters get 15 Skill Points, with each Point able to buy 1 [Stack](Stack.md) in a skill. By default, each character must take at least 5 different Skills. Increasing a Skill's Stack above 5 is much more difficult, and costs double Skill Points (so increasing a Skill's Stack from 5 to 6 would cost 2 points); the cost doubles again at a Stack of 10 (to 4:1), and again at 15 (8:1) - and so on. Skills shouldn't be above 5 on a starting character except under very special or unusual circumstances.

When a Skill's stack reaches 5, you get a free stack of a related Focus. You get an additional free stack in a related focus at 10, and every 5 more stack thereafter. Skill points can also be used to also used to buy Foci individually; see below.

## Foci

A Focus (plural Foci) is a precise area of expertise, even more specific than a Skill. Like Skills, a character almost always needs to have specifically trained in some way to have a focus. A Focus is always a subset of a specific skill. You don't have to actually have a stack in that skill to take a Focus.

Foci are player defined, and have a [Stack](Stack.md) just like a Skill. Foci are pulled for checks just like Skills. So, if you have a Skill with a Stack of 4 and an associated focus with a stack of 2, you would pull both for a total of 6 dice. Unlike other [Characteristics](Characteristic.md), Foci can't provide [Synergy](Synergy.md).

### Defining a Focus

A focus can be seen as a specialization within a Skill, or a laser-focused area of expertise. A Focus that is attached to a Skill is kind of like a doctor's specialty - all doctors have the Medicine skill, but many also have a Specialty, like Pediatrics or Oncology. An independent (unattached) Focus is just a very precise skill.

When defining a character's Foci, try to make them as specific and narrow as makes sense for the character. If you can't think of a time when the character wouldn't use the focus with the skill, then it's too broad, and needs to be narrowed down. A Focus should only be useful *occasionally*. If you're using it even every session there might be a problem.

Alternately, a Focus could be attached to a specific item (Grandfather's Sword, My Custom Cyberdeck, etc.). If you lose the item, you may lose access to the Focus until you find some way to replace what you've lost (a new custom cyberdeck that takes thousands of credits and months of tweaking to set up, tracking down the sword's dwarven maker to craft another, etc.).

In the skill list above, examples of foci are given for each skill. Use these as a guideline.

### Starting Characters - Foci

As indicated above, any Skill with a [Stack](Stack.md) of 5 or higher gets a free Focus with a Stack of 1. In addition, you can use Skill Points to buy additional stacks of Foci at a 1:2 rate (one Skill Point will get you 2 stack of Foci). You may spend up to 4 Skill Points in this manner.

Starting characters can't have a stack above 2 in any given focus.

## Character Creation: What's Next

The next step in [Character Creation](CCSummary.md) is to select between 5 and 10 [Connections](Connections.md).
