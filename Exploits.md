# Exploits

Exploits are special checks you can do. They are designed to cover a variety of edge cases.

## Aid

If you want to help another character out with something, and you have [Skills](Skills.md) that will help, you can make an Aid check. Pull dice into a pool and roll. Success grants the character you're helping [Synergy](Synergy.md) on a check.

There's really no limit to how this mechanic can be used beyond common sense. You don't even have to be using the same Skill as the person you're helping. A few examples:

- You come to an ally's Aid in combat, trying to harry a ranged attacker. You make a Close Combat check that provides Synergy for an ally's Distant Combat check.
- You are part of an investigative team trying to dig up dirt on a local politician. While your lead investigator hits the streets, you do research on the internet, making a Technology check to provide Synergy
- Working as a Spotter, you make checks to notice targets for your Sniper, providing Synergy
- Using your Performance skill, you distract the partygoers while your accomplice does the "hard work" of actually picking pockets or spiking the punch using Thievery or Stealth.

The GM is the final arbiter as to what can qualify, but as long as it makes sense, things should be okay, unless too many people are getting involved...

### Too many Cooks

Only so many people can actually help you out with a single thing. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to establish a limit to how many people can help a single person's check. This is because each situation is different, and some situations will only allow one person to help, while in others every little bit helps.

Each situation is should be judged separately. As a guideline, no more than 2 Synergy should be available for a single action in Combat, and no more than 5 outside of combat. It's all up to situation and description, however.

## Recovery

If you act soon enough after an injury, you might be able to mitigate the damage, or even discover that it's not as bad as you initially thought. A Recovery check, preferably performed by an ally, can remove a Wound if it's not too severe, or it can recover some [Traits](Traits.md) lost due to injury or exhaustion.

### Recover Checks

Recover Checks usually involve a Medical skill check, or something else more setting or character appropriate; perhaps a Druid would use Nature skill, while a Metahuman healer could use [Energy](Energy.md) or whatever skill their power is keyed into.

In any case, make the check. If you are attempting to recover a Wound, then the check has a Difficulty of 3 (depending on the severity of the Wound), otherwise the Difficulty is 0. The Difficulty for a Recovery Check goes up by 1 or more if you're performing it on yourself, and you can't claim [Synergy](Synergy.md) on checks made on yourself.

### Recovering Wounds

If you make a Recovery Check and beat the difficulty, then a wound turns out to not be as bad as initially though, and can be easily treated. A gunshot wound turns out to be a graze or easily (but temporarily) patched up, allowing you to return to action. A painful burn reacts well to the treatment applied or turns out to be a 1st degree burn - however it makes sense to explain it in context.

Sometimes the recovery is only temporary - you can ignore the wound for now, but you need to get medical attention as soon as possible. This happens all the time in Action Movies (remember John McClane's feet in Die Hard?). Other times, especially when dealing with magic or other supernatural aid, the Wound is just healed.

Some Wounds can't be so easily recovered - it's difficult, unless you're The Black Knight, to claim a severed arm is just a flesh wound. These sorts of wounds can't generally be recovered using this exploit without supernatural or ultra-tech help.

Regardless, only 1 Wound can be recovered this way.

### Recovering Burned Characteristics

[Burned](Burn.md) [Traits](Traits.md) can be recovered using any explanation you like, at a rate of 1 for each success on the Recovery check. Since Burned Traits represent bumps and bruises, luck, or other kinds of exhaustion, getting a few back after a scene isn't that big of a deal.

Only one Recovery check can be made after a scene, however, and you need to decide if it should be used for recovering Burn or Wounds.
