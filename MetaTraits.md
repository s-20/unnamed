# Meta Traits

Sometimes characters have a certain something that's difficult to define in terms of direct description. Perhaps they're lucky, or doing things the dangerous way always pays off for them. These characters have Meta Traits.

Meta Traits are selected for a character like any other [Trait](Traits.md) during [Character Creation](CCSummary.md) or [Improvement](Advancement.md), but they work in more specific ways. They might be less reliable, or have diminishing returns, or have a chance of backfiring, or some other restriction.

There are four Meta-traits defined here, but Game Groups are encouraged to come up with their own, using these as a guideline.

## Lucky

Some people are occasionally just lucky. They get through things not due to skill or natural ability, but because the winds of fate are at their backs. Of course, relying on luck can also backfire impressively. Luck can be pulled into any roll regardless of circumstance, and without explanation.

For any check using Luck, quirks cancel successes at a one-for-one rate, and a failed check is a spectacular failure. You should describe how your luck turns against you in some impressive way. If it's your Turn in [Combat](Combat.md), your turn is over and you lose all remaining actions.

## Daredevil

It happens all the time in the movies - that crazy character that runs charging into a hail of bullets, but comes out unscathed. A great example of this is Wyatt Erp in the movie Tombstone (and, at least according to legend, in real life) - in one scene, he walks out into a lake, completely surrounded, and guns down all his attackers without taking a single hit.

The Daredevil trait can be pulled on any check where you deliberately put yourself into danger; if you're playing it safe in any way, like using cover, or there being a net below the tightrope, or you're wearing armor, you can't use the trait.

In order to pull Daredevil, you have to [Burn](Burn.md) it - your luck can't last forever! You don't gain the normal benefits of Burning a Trait, however - your ranks in Daredevil just go down.

## Genre Savvy

To quote [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy):

> A Genre Savvy character doesn't necessarily know they're in a story, but they do know of stories like their own and what worked in them and what didn't. They may attempt to apply the lessons they've learned from movies, books, or other fiction to their own situation, or they may restrict themselves to snarky asides and observations.

You can use Genre Savvy whenever being genre savvy would be helpful, but you have to describe the trope (or what have you) that you're referencing.

## Dilettante

You've picked up a lot of small, oddly specific skills and abilities over the course of your life. Once per scene, you can [Burn](Burn.md) Dilettante to gain dice equal to it's rank. Sometime in the past, you read about or experienced something similar, and can bring your knowledge to bear. Unlike other Traits, Dilettante doesn't recover from Burn after a scene. Instead, it recovers after a Story Arc - the GM lets you know when you get it back, but basically, the Trait recovers once you've completed a major story point.

Have fun describing how you came across such a specific ability, but the planets will never align this way again, and you can't use this Trait twice for the same thing. Something, however small, is different next time, and makes your knowledge on the topic useless - unless, of course, you burn the trait again!.
