# Meta Traits

Sometimes characters have a certain something that's difficult to define in terms of direct description. Perhaps they're lucky, or doing things the dangerous way always pays off for them. These characters have Meta Traits.

Meta Traits are selected for a character like any other [Trait](Traits.md) during [Character Creation](CCSummary.md) or [Improvement](Advancement.md), but they use slightly different rules, and can be used in special ways. They might be less reliable, or have diminishing returns, or have a chance of backfiring, or some other restriction.

Meta Traits can only be [Burned](Burn.md) - they can’t be simply pulled. Burning a Meta Trait does not count towards the limitations on how many [Characteristics](Characteristics.md) you can burn for a single check.

## Lucky

Some people are occasionally just lucky. They get through things not due to skill or natural ability, but because the winds of fate are at their backs. Of course, relying on luck can also backfire impressively. Burning Luck can add dice to *any* dice roll you make, or can provide 1 [Synergy](Synergy.md) to another character’s check.

For any check using Luck, [Quirks](Quirks.md) cancel [Effort](Effort.md) on a one-for-one basis. If you don't get at least one Effort, you should describe how your luck turns against you in some impressive way. If it's your Turn in [Combat](Combat.md), your turn is over and you lose all remaining actions. This does not apply to providing Synergy to other people’s checks, just to your own.

If you have at least one rank in Lucky, add an additional die to the [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) pool at the start of each session.

## Daredevil

It happens all the time in the movies - that crazy character that runs charging into a hail of bullets, but comes out unscathed. A great example of this is Wyatt Erp in the movie Tombstone (and, at least according to legend, in real life) - in one scene, he walks out into a lake, completely surrounded, and guns down all his attackers without taking a single hit.

The Daredevil trait can be Burned for any check where you deliberately put yourself into potentially deadly danger; if you're playing it safe in any way, you can’t pull the trait, so no nets under the tightrope or firing from cover if you want to use Daredevil.

## Genre Savvy

To quote [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy):

> A Genre Savvy character doesn't necessarily know they're in a story, but they do know of stories like their own and what worked in them and what didn't. They may attempt to apply the lessons they've learned from movies, books, or other fiction to their own situation, or they may restrict themselves to snarky asides and observations.

You can use Genre Savvy whenever being genre savvy would be helpful, but you have to describe the trope (or what have you) that you're referencing.

## Dilettante

You've picked up a lot of small, oddly specific skills and abilities over the course of your life. You can [Burn](Burn.md) Dilettante on any check you don’t have the right skill for, because sometime in the past, you learned how to/read about/experienced something that applies, and can bring your knowledge to bear.

If you Burn Dilettante, you cannot pull/burn a [Skill](Skills.md) for the check, although you can still claim Synergy with one if appropriate. Dilettante can't be chosen to recover between scenes; it recovers after a Story Arc. The GM lets you know when you get it back, but basically, the Trait recovers completely once you've completed a major story point.
