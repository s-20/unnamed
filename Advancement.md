# Advancement

As the campaign continues, your character will get better at things. This is primarily accomplished through Advancements.

In addition to Advancements, characters can be improved through Awards. Awards are special improvements or modifications granted to a character during play due to the events of the story, usually due to circumstances in the game.

## Advancements

 Advancements are used to improve your character's abilities. Advancements don't have to be selected right away, but they can't be selected during play. Characters gain an Advancement every other session, with an extra one when some significant plot point is resolved.

To spend an Advancement, select one option from the list below. Each option may only be selected once. Once you have selected 5 different options, however, the available list is reset.

### Advancement Options

There are two different groups of Advancement Options - Common advancements, which are in every game, and Special Options, which may or may not be available in a particular game or for a particular character.

- **Common Advancements** - these options are available in all campaigns by default
  - Increase a [Trait](Traits.md) Stack by 1 or add a new Trait
  - Increase a [Skill](Skills.md)'s Stack by 1 or add a new skill
  - Increase an [Aspect](Aspects.md)'s Stack by 1
  - Increase [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md) by 1
  - Gain 5 [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md)
- **Special Advancement** - these options may not always be available, depending on the campaign, the character, or even the particular Advancement
  - Add an additional [Aspect](Aspects.md)
  - Gain 10 [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md)
  - Improve a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md)
  - Improve a Special Ability's [Energy](Energy) pool or capacity
  - Add 5 to the [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) pool

## Awards

An Award is an improvement to the character gained through role play. Awards are how you improve [Connections](Connections.md), along with some [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md).

Awards are generally gained through good role play, adding interesting things to the story, and especially creative ideas. Just about anything can be given as an Award; two examples are outlined below.

### Connection Awards

You can gain new Connections or improve existing ones through role play. Any time a player thinks their connections have gotten stronger, or they've developed a new one, they can ask the GM for a Connection Award. Alternately, if the GM thinks the Connection has ben strengthened, or a new connection has been forged, they can just award it to the player.

Connections are much more dynamic than any other characteristic, in that they are much more prone to changes in stack, gains, and loss - a Connection can be gained, increase its stack, and be lost all in one story arc - or even in one scene!

### Special Ability Awards

In the unnamed System, [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) are broadly defined, and are often left open ended. This is intentional. For one thing it's a lot easier to say "I have Spider Powers, and they manifest in this way" than it is to rigorously define each aspect of what "Spider Powers" means.

For another thing, this makes it easier to expand the abilities when story and experience require. Maybe your once device-dependent webs are now organic and produced by you. Or maybe your new alien costume (that will never, ever cause problems for you in the future) enhances your strength.

Special Ability awards occur when it's story appropriate: something in the narrative has to have triggered them. They can take a variety of forms; an increase in an [Energy Pool](Energy.md), an expansion of an existing ability, more "spells", et al.

You might get a Special Ability Award by using your power in a cool new way, because you found a spellbook, because you're on a planet with a blue sun, or any of a variety of other circumstances. Often these changes will be permanent; sometimes they will only last a session or two.

## Total Advancement

If you like, you can keep track of the total number of Advancements (including Awards) characters have received. You can use this total as a gauge for how far the characters have come or how "powerful" they are. 

You can also use it to establish Echelons - checkpoints where something new becomes available or something special happens.

### Echelons

Echelons age gained after an arbitrary number of Advancements (including Awards). It could be every five Advancements, every 10, after the first two and then every seven thereafter - however you want to set it up; nothing is wrong as long as it applies equally to all characters.

Upon reaching a new Echelon, characters either receive a special Award, or they gain access to new Advancement options; ideally, they'll get both. In addition, if a player starts up a new character, they start at the same echelon as the group average.

What happens at a new Echelon is up to the individual group or GM, and should be established [Parameters](Parameters.md) discussed during Session 0. They can also be tacked on at any time, or held in a reserve by the GM as a surprise, but generally all the cards should be on the table.

Echelons are an optional rule that can be used to gate off more powerful abilities for later in a long-running campaign.
