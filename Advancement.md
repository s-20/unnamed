# Advancement

As a campaign progresses, characters may learn from their experiences, expanding their abilities and getting better at what they do. In unnamed, this is handled through Advancements, awards handed out during game for exceptional role play. Advancements allow you to add ranks to existing [Characteristics](Characteristics.md) or add new ones. Different Characteristics have different Advancement costs; see the table below.

You can spend Advancements whenever you have them. This means that you can improve a Characteristic immediately before using it, or even add a new one when you need it. You need a decent explanation at the ready as to why you suddenly have a new [Skill](Skills.md) or [Trait](Traits.md), but as long as it's in character, everything should be fine.

Advancements are gained primarily through Storytelling. If you manage to advance the plot significantly, achieve a personal or group goal, or reach some sort of epiphany, you get an advancement. You should also gain an Advancement for completing a minor story arc, and two Advancements for completing a major one. In some games (established in your [Session Zero](Parameters.md)), you will also gain an Advancement at the end of every session.

## Advancement Cost Table

| Improvement                         | Cost              |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| New Aspect                          | 10                |
| Improve Aspect                      | 2x th new Rank    |
| New Trait or Skill                  | 5 Advancements    |
| New Connection                      | 1 or 5, see above |
| Improve Connection, Trait, or Skill | 1x the new Rank   |
| New Focus                           | 2                 |
| New Detail                          | 1                 |
| Expand Special Ability              | 5                 |
| New Special Ability                 | 10                |

There are a few things to keep in mind for the table above:

- In order to add a new Focus, you must have at least two ranks in the associated [Skill](Skills.md).
- New Details only have a cost if they come out of nowhere. Details justified by in-game events, backstory, and so on are always free.
- [Tangles](Tangles.md) can't be bought off or otherwise affected by Advancements; they can only be removed through in-story events.

## Free Success

In addition to using your Advancements to improve your character, you can also use them during game to achieve success without rolling. By spending an Advancement in place of rolling dice, you can succeed at any check where you could pull an Aspect or Focus. You achieve minimal success without extra [Effort](Effort.md) to spend on [Stunts](Stunts.md), and your success is without [Quirks](Quirks.md). This is kind of a dull way to succeed, and it hampers the advancement of your character, but sometimes you just really need a win.
