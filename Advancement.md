# Advancement

As a campaign progresses, characters may learn from their experiences, expanding their abilities and getting better at what they do. In unnamed, this is handled through Advancements, which allow you to add ranks to existing [Characteristics](Characteristics.md) or add new ones. Different Characteristics have different Advancement costs; see the [table](#advancement-cost-table) below.

You can spend Advancements whenever you have them. This means that you can improve a Characteristic immediately before using it, or even add a new one when you need it. You need a decent explanation at the ready as to why you suddenly have a new [Skill](Skills.md) or [Trait](Traits.md), but as long as it's in character, everything should be fine.

## Gaining Advancements

Characters gain 1 Advancement each session regardless of other circumstances. If a story arc was resolved or a major breakthrough in the plot occurred during a session, they gain an additional Advancement.

> **Individual Awards**
> 
> Individual awards are optional in unnamed; most of the time, it's best to keep all characters on an even playing field. Among other reasons, this makes it easy to tell a new player or a player making a new character for the game how many Advancements they have, so their character is on the same footing as the rest of the PCs.
> 
> If the GM or the game group thinks some action or bit of role-play is worthy of an Advancement, it's fine to award one here or there though. It might also be appropriate to grant an Advancement if a character achieves a significant personal goal, or if they resolve a [Tangle](Tangles.md).

## Advancement Cost Table

Improvement                           | Cost
-----------------------------------   | -----------------
New Aspect                            | 5
Improve Aspect                        | 2x the new Rank
New Trait, Skill, or Connection       | 3
Improve a Trait, Skill, or Connection | 1x the new Rank
New Focus                             | 2
Expand Special Ability                | 5
New Special Ability                   | 10

Gaining a new Focus requires you to have at least two ranks in the associated Skill; see [Skills](Skills.md).
