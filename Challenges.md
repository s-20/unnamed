# Challenges

Challenges are things that your character seeks to overcome, or difficulties they have to deal with on a day to day basis. All characters have Challenges.

Challenges are similar to [Complications](Complications.md); in fact, you can think of them as being to Complications what [Aspects](Aspects.md) are to [Traits](Traits.md). A Challenge is a major part of a character, something that defines them as much as the things they are good at.

Challenges are there to provide roleplay hooks and to provide interesting difficulties for the character to overcome. They aren't there to punish players, but players should keep them in mind, and any player can call out another player's Challenges to make a scene more interesting.

You don't have to take a Challenge if you don't want one for your character - that's not a big deal, see Unchallenged, below.

## Types of Challenges

There are four types of Challenge:

- **Compulsions**: A behavior or response that the character feels compelled to do; this covers addictive behaviors, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and similar problems.
- **Fears and Obsessions**: Something that the character is irrationally terrified of or obsessed with. Phobias and overwhelming goals can both qualify, as can things like extreme vows or codes of honor.
- **Physical Disabilities**: Disabilities are things that present major challenges to day to day life. In order to qualify as a Challenge, it has to be severe - being paraplegic, having an absent sense (blindness, deafness, etc.), or other similar major difficulty.
- **Psychological/Mood Disorders**: General anxiety, severe depression, schizophrenia, sociopathy, and other things qualify.

There is no penalty if you decide your character doesn't have a Challenge. You can just skip this step if you like. No judgement - Challenges are here to provide a mechanical way to reflect serious issues a character might face. If the character doesn't have those issues, then no worries.

Challenges are encouraged because they provide roleplay opportunities, but they're not here to force you into playing a character you don't want to play, or to deal with things that make you uncomfortable. 

If, when setting campaign [Parameters](Parameters.md), you want to leave them out completely, and let [Complications](Complications.md) serve that purpose instead, that's absolutely fine - the system works without them.
