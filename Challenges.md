# Challenges - DRAFT

Challenges are things that your character seeks to overcome, or difficulties they have to deal with on a day to day basis. All characters have Challenges.

Challenges are similar to [Complications](Complications.md); in fact, you can think of them as being to Complications what [Aspects](Aspects.md) are to [Traits](Traits.md). A Challenge is a major part of a character, something that defines them as much as the things they are good at.

Challenges are there to provide roleplay hooks and to provide interesting difficulties for the character to overcome. They aren't there to punish players, but players should keep them in mind, and any player can call out another player's Challenges to make a scene more interesting.

You don't have to take a Challenge if you don't want one for your character - that's not a big deal, see Unchallenged, below.

## Types of Challenges

There are six types of Challenge:

- **Opposition** - There is someone of not insignificant power that wants to stop you or see you dead. Or perhaps you have an entire Rogue's Gallery, or you're wanted by the authorities - whatever the case there are forces that exist to thwart you, imprison you, or kill you.
- **Overriding Motivations**: These are goals that the character pursues despite possible physical/psychological harm, social consequences, or even risk of death. In short, they're things the character thinks are worth dying for - and perhaps more.
- **Fears and Obsessions**: Something that the character is irrationally terrified of or obsessed with. Phobias and overwhelming goals can both qualify, as can things like extreme vows or codes of honor.
- **Physical Disabilities**: Some physical disorder or disability that present major challenges to day to day life.
- **Psychological/Mood Disorders**: General anxiety, severe depression, schizophrenia, sociopathy, obsessions and compulsions, use disorders, and other things qualify.
- **Social Stigmas**: Depending on the [Parameters](Parameters.md) of your game, just existing as a certain type of person can be a major enough issue to qualify as a Challenge. Perhaps you're playing a Mutant in the Marvel Universe, or you're a psychic in a world where that sort of thing is outlawed. There are more realistic possibilities, but make sure everyone at the table is comfortable with what you're doing before you hit too close to home.
  
## Defining Challenges

Challenges are selected and defined by the players with the help of the GM. Basically, as long as it poses a challenge for the character, it can be a Challenge. There are only a few rules:

1. No player can be forced to play or otherwise deal with a Challenge they don't want or that makes them uncomfortable
2. Similarly, no Challenge can be taken that makes another player or the GM uncomfortable. Literally anyone can veto anyone else's Challenge, or request a Fade To Black when it comes up.
3. The Challenge must be significant. Although it probably won't come up every session, it should be possible for it to come up every session.

And that's it. C

## Pulling Challenges

## Unchallenged

There is no penalty if you decide your character doesn't have a Challenge. You can just skip this step if you like. No judgement - Challenges are here to provide a mechanical way to reflect serious issues a character might face. If the character doesn't have those issues, then no worries.

Challenges are encouraged because they provide roleplay opportunities, but they're not here to force you into playing a character you don't want to play, or to deal with things that make you uncomfortable. 

If, when setting campaign [Parameters](Parameters.md), you want to leave them out completely, and let [Complications](Complications.md) serve that purpose instead, that's absolutely fine - the system works without them.
