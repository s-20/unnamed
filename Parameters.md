# Parameters

This page discusses establishing the parameters of the campaign. It will discuss *session zero*, deciding on a genre of play, levels of realism, and a variety of other topics.

All of this is stuff that you need to hash out before every new campaign, and it's best to do it in a group (in person or online), so that everyone is on the same page when the game starts. You can usually also take care of character creation while discussing these things, although it's best to get a pretty good handle on everything below before you get too deep into character meat and potatoes.

## Genre and Theme

Genre and Theme are what sort of story the game is, and what it will deal with. Genera means what you think it means: science fiction, superheroes, and so on. It's about the milieu of the story and what basic tropes you can expect to see. Theme is a bit more difficult to describe, but it has to do with things like tone and perspective.

### Realism

How "realistic" the game is expected to be - hardcore realism (like Saving Private Ryan), presence and influence of magic, super-science, comic-book physics, and so on. This is generally part of the Genre of the game, and it helps define both what sort of characters everyone will be playing and the sorts of Special Abilities you can expect to see.

### Special Abilities

What [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) are available. In this case, we're also talking about the types available - for instance, in a Science Fiction game you might allow Special Abilities based on psionics, but not magic. Also important is a discussion of the relative power level of any Special Abilities.

Theme and Genre are a good guide here, as is Realism. Are you playing a Fantasy game? Great! How powerful is magic? How common is it? Are there non-human races? What powers do they have?

### Wound Threshold

[Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md) gets its own article, but in brief, it measures how much punishment a character can take, and means different things depending on how much of it you have. Low Wound Thresholds reflect a more "realistic" perception of damage, where taking a wound actually represents significant injury.

As a rough guide:

- **Normal**: 3. Most of the time, characters can only take 3 Wounds before they're taken out of action (or reduced to severely limited options).
- **Cinematic**: 5. In the movies, heroes can shrug off bullet wounds and even getting stabbed in the gut. So cinematic heroes need a few more wounds, although nothing to ridiculous.

## Content Consent: Opting In and Opting Out

Other people have done a much better job at discussing this than I ever could. I strongly recommend reading [Consent in Gaming](https://www.montecookgames.com/consent-in-gaming/) by Sean K. Reynolds and Shana Germain. It's free, it's not overly long, and it's an excellent guide to how consent and respect for boundaries should work at the gaming table.

In short, though, when discussing the parameters of the game, it's important to also establish if there are any off-limits topics respectfully. In addition, players should be able to opt-out *at any time* and *without question or judgement*. Games should be fun, and they should be a space where you can feel safe with your friends.

If you find yourself scoffing at the idea of consent at the gaming table, or think this is some sort of SJW plot to ruin your fun, you're welcome to play a different game.
