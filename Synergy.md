# Synergy

Synergy can occur when you have more than one [Aspect](Aspects.md), [Trait](Traits.md) or [Skill](Skills.md) that applies to a given given check, when you receive help from an ally, or when you *accidentally* get a little help from an opponent. Synergy can grant you extra dice for a check or provide other effects depending on the circumstance.

Basically, whenever you can claim Synergy, you get an extra die for your check. *You can claim up to 5 additional dice this way*, making Synergy a valuable tool.

There are three main ways to get Synergy: with a little help from another character, having an extra [Characteristic](Characteristic.md) that applies to the check, and by taking advantage of someone else's mistakes.

## Helping Out

It can be good to help someone out. If you want to help someone else make a check, pull Characteristics as though you're going to make the check yourself. For every 4 Dice you can scrounge together, you can contribute 1 die of Synergy to your ally's check.

You can't always help out; sometimes, a character simply isn't a position to accept help. There is also often a limit to how many people can help - too many cooks spoil the broth, after all. Although it is up to the GM to decide, the default limit for helpers is two.

## Synergistic Characteristics

Sometimes you have an extra [Skill](Skills.md) or Focus that can help with a check. It's not the main thing you're doing, but the knowledge you gained from the other skill would definitely help out the current check. For example, if you're selling a sword, that's a Merchant skill check, obviously - but if you have a Swords skill, your knowledge of blades should help you out.

If you can claim Synergy with another skill, you gain an additional die for a [Stack](Stack.md) of 5 below, and 2 dice for a higher stack. If you have a Focus that applies, that works the same way.

You can only claim Synergy from one skill per check.

## An Opening!

If an opponent screws up, you can take advantage of the situation. Someone may commit a social faux pas, allowing you to step in and shine. Or perhaps an opponent swings their sword a bit wild - whatever the case, you can claim Synergy.

This operates differently depending on whether or not you are in combat when it happens.
