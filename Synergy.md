# Synergy

Synergy happens when there are beneficial circumstances that apply to a roll. You can claim Synergy under the following circumstances:

- Favorable circumstances
- Another character's assistance
- Good equipment or tools
- A [Skill Focus](Skills.md)
- A [Detail](Details.md)
- A [Tangle](Tangles.md) that happens to work to your advantage

## Benefits of Synergy

Synergy provides an additional die to roll for the check, up to a maximum of +3 dice. In addition, Synergy provides +1 [Effort](Effort.md) as long as you roll at least 1 Effort on a check for every 5 total Synergy you have.

Synergy can provide other benefits depending on the circumstances. For example, it might provide additional insights, reveal extra clues, or grant additional depth to a success.
