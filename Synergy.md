# Synergy

Synergy can occur when you have more than one [Aspect](Aspects.md), [Trait](Traits.md) or [Skill](Skills.md) that applies to a given given check, when you receive help from an ally, or when you *accidentally* get a little help from an opponent. Synergy can grant you extra dice for a check or provide other effects depending on the circumstance.

Basically, whenever you can claim Synergy, you get an extra die for your check. You can claim up to 5 additional dice this way, making such cooperation a valuable tool.
