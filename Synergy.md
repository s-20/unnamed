# Synergy

Synergy can happen when you have an appropriate Focus, have at least 5 ranks in a [Skill](Skills.md) other than the one you're using for the check, but that could contribute to its success, or in other specific circumstances. You can also provide Synergy for an ally with a successful Aid or other [Exploit](Exploits.md).

## Benefits of Synergy

If you have Synergy, you can use it in one of three ways:

- Add two Dice to a check
- Add one [Effort](Effort.md) to a check if you roll at least one Effort for it
- Re-roll all Quirks; you can only re-roll dice once
- Add one die to the [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) pool if the Drama Dice pool is less than 5

You must decide how you're going to spend your Synergy before you roll.

## Greater Synergy

You can get Synergy more than once, but only once from any given source - for example, you could gain Synergy from having 5 ranks in a skill, and from a Aid exploit used by an ally, but that ally couldn't do anything to add more synergy, and neither could you.

You can use one extra Synergy for an additional effect as described above, but further Synergy is lost. Alternately, if you have at least 3 Synergy, you can choose one of the following instead:

- Count Effort on a 4, 5, or 6 instead of 5 or 6
- Re-roll any die result of 1, 2, or 3; you can only re-roll dice once
- Gain +1 Effort to a related check in the same scene; this Effort can be gifted to a different character
- Add one die to the Drama DIce pool if the Drama Dice pool is less than 10

All of these options take 3 Synergy. You must decide how you're going to spend Synergy before your roll.
