# Synergy

Synergy happens when there are beneficial circumstances that apply to a roll. You can claim Synergy under the following circumstances:

- A [Characteristic](Characteristics.md) of a type you've already pulled that applies to the roll if you have 5 or more ranks in it
- Conditions that are especially favorable
- Another character's assistance
- Good equipment or tools
- A [Skill Focus](Skills.md)
- A [Detail](Details.md)
- A [Tangle](Tangles.md) that happens to work to your advantage

Each specific source can provide only 1 Synergy, and can only be claimed once per check.

## Benefits of Synergy

Synergy always provides +1 [Effort](Effort.md) as long as you roll at least 1 Effort on a check. In addition, add another die to your check if you have 5 or more Synergy.

Synergy can provide other benefits depending on the circumstances. For example, it might provide additional insights, reveal extra clues, or grant additional depth to a success.
