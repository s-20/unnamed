# Synergy

Synergy can occur when you have more than one [Aspect](Aspects.md), [Trait](Traits.md) or [Skill](Skills.md) that applies to a given given check, when you receive help from an ally, or when you *accidentally* get a little help from an opponent. Synergy can grant you extra dice for a check or provide other effects depending on the circumstance.

Basically, whenever you can claim Synergy, you get an extra die for your check. *You can claim up to 5 additional dice this way*, making Synergy a valuable tool.

There are two main ways to get Synergy: with a little help from another character and having an extra [Skill or Focus](Skills.md) that applies to the check. You can also claim Synergy with a situation if you think circumstances are particularly advantageous.

## Helping Out

It can be good to help someone out. If you want to help someone else make a check, pull Characteristics as though you're going to make the check yourself. For every 4 Dice you can scrounge together, you can contribute 1 die of Synergy to your ally's check.

You can't always help out; sometimes, a character simply isn't a position to accept help. There is also often a limit to how many people can help - too many cooks spoil the broth, after all. Although it is up to the GM to decide, the default limit for helpers is two.

## Synergistic Skills and Foci

Sometimes you have an extra [Skill](Skills.md) or Focus that can help with a check. It's not the main thing you're doing, but the knowledge you gained from the other skill would definitely help out the current check. For example, if you're selling a sword, that's a Merchant skill check, obviously - but if you have a Swords skill, your knowledge of blades should help you out.

If you can claim Synergy with another skill, you gain an additional die for a [Stack](Stack.md) of 5 below, and 2 dice for a higher stack. If you have a Focus that applies, that works the same way. You can only claim Synergy from one skill or one focus per check.

## Synergistic Situations

Sometimes everything lines up just right. The planets align, and everything is just going your way. Your opponent left an opening, you've picked this brand of lock a million times, you notice that that lasers are pulsing to the same beat as your favorite song, or you're on your home turf.

When circumstances are especially beneficial to what you're trying to do, you can try to claim Synergy. One example of such Synergy is the [Equipment Bonus](Stuff.md) you can claim if you have a particular item listed on your character sheet. Another example is the Accuracy dice gained through the [Aim Action](CombatActions.md) during an [Engagement](Engagement.md).

Outside of specific examples like the above, Synergy can be granted for good description or RP, or you can ask for it whenever you think things are just right. The GM can approve or disapprove, but should generally side with the player. Depending on the situation, the GM will then give you one or more Synergy dice.

## Synergy Summary

Claiming Synergy can grant you additional dice for a check, up to a *maximum of 5 dice*. You can claim Synergy with circumstances, a second [Skill](Skills.md) or Focus that applies to a check, or with help from allies.
