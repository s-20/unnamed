# Details

Details are little quirky parts of your character that are only helpful in rare or obscure circumstances. Details are ways to fill out the quirks and individualistic things that make your character unique.

During Character Creation, you can take up to 5 Details. You don't have to take them right way in a longer campaign - you can fill them in over the course of the first few sessions as you get to know your character. In a shorter game, however, it's a good idea to get at least 3 good details down to help round out your character.

## Creating Details

Details represent very minor characteristics - things less broadly useful than even a [Focus](Skills.md). They're meant to add a few interesting twists to a character.

Details should follow these guidelines:

- *Specific* - A detail is a specific thing, like being exceptionally tall, or having one eye, or being a Manchester United fan
- *Not obviously useful* - Details aren't a place to get one over on the system (let's face it - that's not hard to do). If something seems immediately and obviously useful, it might fit better as a [Focus](Skills.md), a [Connection](Connections.md), or some other [Characteristic](Characteristic.md). This doesn't mean it *won't* be useful, just that if you think it might come up several times in the campaign, it's not a detail.
- *Minor* - Details are the little things. Even if something's specific and not obviously useful, if it's a big deal, it can't be a Detail. FOr example, if you're a clone, that's probably not a detail, even in a campaign where clones are common.

### Example One: Terry Knows ALGOL

Linda's character Terry is a white-hat hacker and a computer programmer. Ze thinks that a good quirk for Terry would be to know a specific Computer Language. She bounces the idea of C++ off zer GM, but it (rightly) told that being fluent in one of the most ubiquitous object-oriented programming languages in history isn't a "detail" - it's just part of Terry's Computers (Programmer) skill.

After a little research, Linda decides that Terry in fascinated with and knows a lot about old, completely outdated computer languages. Linda tells zer GM that Terry knows ALGOL.

GM: What the hell is ALGOL?

Linda: It's a dead computer language from the fifties and sixties.

GM: Well alright then.

So, on Terry's character sheet, ze writes down "Knows ALGOL".

### Example Two: From the Princess Bride

Let's talk about The Princess Bride.

Remember the scene when the Dread Pirate Roberts gets into a duel of intellect with Viccini? How he had spent years developing an immunity to the poison iocane, apparently just in case a situation like this came up?

That's a Detail. Immunity or resistance to all poison is far too broad - that's probably a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md). Immunity or resistance to all snake venom, or to all neurotoxins, or to all synthetic poisons is likewise too broad.

Immunity to one very specific poison works really well, though. My character is immune to Death Dust, or cyanide, or iocane all work great. You can't use toxins that are widely consumed in a recreational capacity (alcohol, marijuana, etc.), just obscure or expensive individual poisons.

### Example Three: Being Polylingual

**For more information**: [Languages](Languages.md)

Unless you decide otherwise, your character is considered fluent and literate in any language that's part of their background. Additional languages are considered detail - one language per Detail, with dialects/pidgins thrown in as a bonus if they're in character.

## Holding Off


As previously noted, if you can't come up with all your details right away, that's not a big deal. They can be filled in as they come up.

This works best in a game that's going to last several sessions at least, but you can just claim a detail (again, up to five total) when a situation demands it. Remembering the guidelines above, with the one change that it can actually be *very* useful to the specific situation when it comes up.

The added Detail must *make sense*. You can't just throw random little things in to get you out of trouble. It needs to have some reasonable explanation within the context of you background, other Details, Skills, or established events.

For instance, the player controlling Wesley in the Princess Bride could have claimed the Iocane Powder detail right when they needed it to win the battle of the brains. He had been training - hard - to return to Buttercup, was a master strategist, and was quite knowledgeable in how to kill people - it as reasonable to believe that he might do something like develop an immunity to a poison in case something like this came up.

## New Details

You can gain new details at any time during play. Like a [Connection](Connections.md), the GM can give you one whenever they think it's appropriate. Likewise, if something happens that you think might make a good addition to your character, you can ask the game group if you can add it to your character.

## Using Details

Details can be used in a variety of ways. They are sort of like every characteristic taken to a microscopic level. You can pull them like Skills or Traits into the rare check where they're appropriate, or they can provide passive benefits.

If you pull a Detail, it provides a Die just like a 1 Stack [Skill](Skills.md). Details cannot be [Stacked](Stack.md), but they can provide passive effects, or even grant automatic success with a task if it seems approrpriate.

## Character Creation: What's Next

The next step in [Character Creation](CCSummary.md) is to select [Complications](Complications.md); while this is technically optional, it's a very good idea.
