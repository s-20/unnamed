# Details

Details are little quirky parts of your character that are only helpful in rare or obscure circumstances. Details are ways to fill out the peculiarities things that make your character unique.

During Character Creation, you can add a few Details if you’d like, but you should try to keep the list short (at least to start). You don't have to take them right way, either - details don’t make a huge mechanical difference, and so can be added as they come up.

## Creating Details

Details represent very minor characteristics - things less broadly useful than even a [Focus](Skills.md). They're meant to add a few interesting twists to a character.

Details should follow these guidelines:

- *Specific* - A detail is a specific thing, like being exceptionally tall, or having one eye, or being a Manchester United fan
- *Not obviously useful* - Details aren't a place to get one over on the system (let's face it - that's not hard to do). If something seems immediately and obviously useful, it might fit better as a [Focus](Skills.md), a [Connection](Connections.md), or some other [Characteristic](Characteristics.md). This doesn't mean it won't be useful, just that if you think it might come up several times in the campaign, it's not a detail.
- *Minor* - Details are the little things. Even if something's specific and not obviously useful, if it's a big deal, it can't be a Detail. For example, if you're a clone, that's probably not a detail, except in a campaign where clones are common.

### Example One: Terry Knows ALGOL

Linda's character Terry is a white-hat hacker and a computer programmer. Linda thinks that a good quirk for Terry would be to know a specific Computer Language. They bounce the idea of C++ off their GM, but is (rightly) told that being fluent in one of the most ubiquitous object-oriented programming languages in history isn't a "detail" - it's just part of Terry's Operate-Computers skill.

After a little research, Linda decides that Terry is fascinated with old, completely outdated computer languages. Linda tells their GM that Terry knows ALGOL.

GM: What the hell is ALGOL?

Linda: It's a dead computer language from the fifties and sixties.

GM: Well alright then.

So, on Terry's character sheet, they write down "Knows ALGOL".

### Example Two: Iocane Powder

Let's talk about The Princess Bride.

Remember the scene when the Dread Pirate Roberts gets into a duel of intellect with Viccini? How he had spent years developing an immunity to the poison iocane, apparently just in case a situation like this came up?

That's a Detail. Immunity or resistance to all poison is far too broad - that's probably a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md) or a [Wound Threshold Note](WoundThreshold.md). Immunity or resistance to all snake venom, or to all neurotoxins, or to all synthetic poisons is likewise too broad. Immunity to one very specific poison works really well, though. My character is immune to Death Dust, or Black Lotus Powder, or iocane all work well. You can't use toxins that are widely consumed in a recreational capacity (alcohol, marijuana, etc.), just obscure or expensive individual poisons.

## New Details

You can gain new details at any time during play. Like a [Connection](Connections.md), the GM can give you one whenever they think it's appropriate. Likewise, if something happens that you think might make a good addition to your character, you can ask the game group if you can add it to your character.

## Using Details

Details can be used in a variety of ways. They are sort of like every characteristic taken to a microscopic level. If you pull a Detail, it provides [Synergy](Synergy.md) for the check. You can only gain 1 Synergy from Details, no matter how many you have that apply.

Details can come up in other ways. A detail might allow you to notice something you wouldn’t have otherwise, or get drawn into a situation for any of a number of other reasons. If you aren’t directly pulling the Detail, as described above, it might allow a check you wouldn’t get otherwise, or it might add a [Quirk](Quirks.md) to your check results; kind of like a very minor [Tangle](Tangles.md). Only one Quirk can be added to your check in this way, no matter how many Details might apply.
