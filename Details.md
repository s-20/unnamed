# Details

Details are little quirky parts of your character that are only helpful in rare or obscure circumstances. Details are ways to fill out the quirks and individualistic things that make your character unique. Details can also be used to refine a character's [Skills](Skills.md).

Characters get 5 Details for free, with further Details available with Adjustment Points. Can't think of 5 little quirky things about your character? No problem - just Hold Off (see below) on picking them.

## Creating Details

It would be impossible to make a list of Details for characters to choose from. Details are intentionally super-specific things that are individualized to the character. In a way, you can think of them as being the opposite of [Aspects](Aspects.md) - where Aspects represent major, driving aspects of your character, Details are the little tiny things that make us all human. Either way, you must tailor them to each specific character.

Details can be things you know, behaviors, things you're interested in, affectations, appearance quirks, or anything else you can think of, as long as it isn't broadly applicable. Let's take a look at a few examples:

### Example One: Terry Knows ALGOL

Linda's character Terry is a white-hat hacker and a computer programmer. Ze thinks that a good quirk for Terry would be to know a specific Computer Language. She bounces the idea of C++ off zer GM, but it (rightly) told that being fluent in one of the most ubiquitous object-oriented programming languages in history isn't a "detail" - it's just part of Terry's Computers (Programmer) skill.

After a little research, Linda decides that Terry in fascinated with and knows a lot about old, completely outdated computer languages. Linda tells zer GM that Terry knows ALGOL.

GM: What the hell is ALGOL?

Linda: It's a dead computer language from the fifties and sixties.

GM: That's... super obscure. Did you want to expand that to 'Dead Computer Languages'?

Linda (after a pause): Sure, why not?

So, on Terry's character sheet, ze writes down "Knows dead computer languages (especially ALGOL)"

### Example Two: From the Princess Bride

Let's talk about The Princess Bride.

Remember the scene when the Dread Pirate Roberts gets into a duel of intellect with Viccini? How he had spent years developing an immunity to the poison iocane, apparently just in case a situation like this came up?

Yeah, that's a Detail. Immunity or resistance to all poison is far too broad. Immunity or resistance to all snake venom, or to all neurotoxins, or to all synthetic poisons is likewise too broad.

Immunity to one very specific poison works really well, though. My character is immune to Death Dust, or cyanide, or iocane all work great. You can't use toxins that are widely consumed in a recreational capacity (alcohol, marijuana, etc.), just obscure or expensive individual poisons.

### Example Three: Being Polylingual

**For more information**: [Languages](Languages.md)

Unless you decide otherwise, your character is considered fluent and literate in any language that's part of their background. Additional languages are considered detail - one language per Detail, with dialects/pidgins thrown in as a bonus if they're in character.

## Holding Off

If you can't come up with five details for your character during character creation, you can Hold Off, adding in the details when they come up in play or whenever you think of them. This really isn't a big deal - you just leave space on your character sheet, and whenever you think of the detail, add it. You can use details acquired this way immediately; in fact, you can come up with a detail in response to a situation and add it while you're using it for a check.

This rule only applies to any Details for your character - the base five all characters receive, of course, but you can also spend [Adjustment Points](CharacterCreation.md) to buy Detail "slots" to be filled in later. This can be a fun way to play one of those characters who has a lot of really obscure skills or abilities - always the one they need at the time.

## New Details

You can gain new details at any time during play. Like a [Connection](Connections.md), the GM can give you one whenever they think it's appropriate. You can also use [Adjustment Points gained through Advancement](Advancement.md) to buy "detail slots" that can be filled in at the time or whenever they come up in play.

## Using Details

Details can be used in a variety of ways. They are sort of like every characteristic taken to a microscopic level. You can pull them like Skills or Traits into the rare check where they're appropriate, or they can provide passive benefits.

Details can't be stacked, but they are otherwise pulled like [Traits](Traits.md), and can also be [Burned](Burn.md) in the same way.

## Character Creation: What's Next

The next step in [Character Creation](CCSummary.md) is to select [Complications](Complications.md); while this is technically optional, it's a very good idea.
