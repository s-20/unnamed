# Details

Details are little quirky parts of your character that are only helpful in rare or obscure circumstances. Details are ways to fill out the peculiarities things that make your character unique.

During Character Creation, you can add a few Details if you’d like, but you should try to keep the list short (at least to start). You don't have to take them right way, either - details don’t make a huge mechanical difference, and so can be added as they come up.

## Creating Details

Details represent very minor [Characteristics](Characteristics.md).  They're meant to add a few interesting and potentially useful twists to a character.

Details should follow these guidelines:

- *Specific* - A detail is a specific thing, like being exceptionally tall, or having one eye, or being a Manchester United fan
- *Not obviously useful* - Details aren't a place to get one over on the system (let's face it - that's not hard to do). If something seems immediately and obviously useful, it should be some other [Characteristic](Characteristics.md). This doesn't mean it won't be useful, just that if you think it might come up several times in the campaign, it's not a detail.
- *Minor* - Details are the little things. Even if something's specific and not obviously useful, if it's a big deal, it can't be a Detail.
- *It isn't a [Tangle](Tangles.md)* - Details shouldn't be things that get you into trouble as a default state. "Bit of a problem drinker" might seem minor enough, but it's much more likely to cause problems than be helpful, and probably deserves to be a Tangle instead of a detail, for instance.

### Iocane Powder

Let's talk about The Princess Bride.

Remember the scene when the Dread Pirate Roberts gets into a duel of intellect with Viccini? How he had spent years developing an immunity to the poison iocane, apparently just in case a situation like this came up?

That's a Detail. Immunity or resistance to all poison is far too broad - that's probably a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md) or a [Wound Threshold Note](WoundThreshold.md). Immunity or resistance to all snake venom, or to all neurotoxins, or to all synthetic poisons might also be too broad. Immunity to one specific poison works really well, though. My character is immune to Death Dust, or Black Lotus Powder, or iocane all work well.

### Lojban

There's a [Constructed Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) out there called [Lojban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban); it's a language intended to be universal based on logical principles, and has a wonderfully complete grammar. It hasn't gained a lot of ground in the world, but it does have a few hundred (thousand?) speakers in the world. Knowing Lojban might make a quirky Detail for a character; it says something about them, could come in handy in a somewhat rare or bizarre circumstance, and provides no obvious general benefit on a day-to-day basis. If, however, during the game you run into a fellow Lojbanist, it could be *very* useful, establishing an immediate connection and common thread.

Knowing Lojban is a neat Detail. [Language](Languages.md) is largely hand-waved in unnamed, but knowing a strange, obscure, or subculturally significant language is a Detail. In the Star Trek setting, knowing Kingon is just a part of your character's background. On modern day earth, it's a Detail.

### Equipment Details

We all know someone who always carries a pocket knife or a multitool. As indicated in the [Stuff](Stuff.md) article, if it makes sense for a character to always have a piece of equipment, then they probably have it. But if there's something small that you *always* have, that might be a detail. Depending on the tone of your game, having such a detail could give you access to such a thing *even if it doesn't make sense for you to have it* - like the character that, after being strip-and-cavity searched still has their trusty pocket knife.

Things like this should generally not be useful as more than an improvised weapon, and should probably be small and easily missed. *Always has a paperclip* is fine for most games, while *never without their Tank* isn't. Larger things can work as details in sillier games - discuss it with your GM and game group. 

## New Details

You can gain new details at any time during play. Like a [Connection](Connections.md), the GM can give you one whenever they think it's appropriate. Likewise, if something happens that you think might make a good addition to your character, you can ask the game group if you can add it to your character. You don't generally need to spend [Advancements](Advancement.md) to get new Details, unless they come completely out of left field.

## Using Details

From a mechanical standpoint, on the rare occasion that a Detail can be of some help to a check, it grants you [Synergy](Synergy.md). Details can't be burned or pulled for checks, but if more than one Detail applies, then you get Synergy for each one.

Details can come up in other ways. A detail might allow you to notice something you wouldn’t otherwise, or get drawn into a situation for any of a number of other reasons. It might also allow a check you wouldn’t get otherwise.
