# Under Review

This is a “shadow article” where I list pages that I need to look at, for potential deletion (and deletion of references). I’m keeping at leas some of these articles (sometimes sticking old_, old., or z.old. in front of the name to break any links I miss) for historical reasons, and because they might contain some ideas I want to pull back into the game.

[[Perks.md]] - Not sure I’m going to use this mechanic at all. Basically does the same thing as Drama Dice and adds needless complication. Need to remove references.
[[old_Stack.md]] - Stack was a pointlessly obtuse way to reference ranks of something when the term has a more familiar meaning in TTRPGs. Need to remove references to Stack.md, and clean up stack related language throughout the wiki
[[old.Complications.md]] - Replaced with [Tangles](Tangles.md), which allowed for more prosaic language. Need to clean up references. 
[[z.old.Conditions.md]] - The whole COnditions article needs to be rewritten. Since unnamed has gotten a lot more go-with-the-flow, rigidly designed conditions no longer make sense, but they are still a tightly integrated part of the game.
[[Advancement.md]] - Needs revamping and rewriting
[[SpecialAbilities]] - Special Abilities needs a lot of help. Since I’m going more freeform with it, it needs a complete rewrite, which is a damn shame, since it’s some of my best page formatting.
