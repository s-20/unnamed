# Effort

Effort represents how effective you are at what you're trying to do. On a check, each die result of 5 or 6 counts as 1 Effort. You must meet a certain Effort requirement (the Difficulty) in order to fully succeed.

Effort in excess of the Difficulty can be spent on "special effects" - that is, small short-term benefits that will aid you or your allies in the scene, although depending on what you're trying to do, the special effects could actually linger for quite a while. Some things are just sort of binary - you succeed or you don't, and extra flair doesn't really help. In these cases, extra Effort is just good for "cool points".

## Difficulty

Difficulty is how hard something is to do with complete success - that is, how hard it is to achieve the desired results *as desired*. If your Effort isn't up to the task, you might still succeed, it will just come with a catch.

The difficulty of a task is determined by the GM, although you are free to suggest a Difficulty if you think a task is especially difficult. Most of the time, Difficulty should be 5 or less, erring to the lower side. In some instances it may be higher, and there's technically no cap, but if a task seems like it would require more than 10 Effort, it might be better to just rule it as impossible.

When figuring difficulty, the key is to remember that you're trying to guess how hard it is, not how hard it is for you or your character. A well made lock might have a Difficulty 3 to pick it. It doesn't get easier if you or your character are a locksmith, your character is just more likely to accomplish the task well.

Another thing to note, however is that because characters are considered to be good at anything they have at least one rank in, they shouldn't be bothered with trivialities. In the above example, if time isn't an issue and you don't care about leaving a mark, then of course you can pick the lock - don't roll, just do it. It's Difficulty 0 to do a crap job at something you're good at. If you're in doubt, refer to the [Overkill](Overkill.md) rules.

## Special Effects

Any successes you get beyond the Difficulty can be pent for Special Effects. These are little extra benefits that can help you out going forward, or can contribute to the story. A few examples might be:

- When picking a lock, you do it much faster than you originally anticipated - the lock just pops, and you leave no scratches or other marks to tell anyone that the lock's been picked.
- You're disarming a trap, and find you can reset it after your friends get through, impeding the progress of anyone who might be following you, or you recognize a "signature" in the work and know something about who set it
- You don't just fix the car, you optimize the engine and squeeze a few more horses out of the engine; gain +1 Effort in your next car chase!

Any of the above could be gained with just 1 extra effort. You can gain multiple different benefits, or you can combine the extra effort into larger benefits - in [Combat](Combat.md), for instance, 2 extra effort can be spent to deal an extra level of damage.

Sometimes, there's nothing obvious to be gained from the situation at hand. In that case, the extra effort is lost, and you just look cool accomplishing your goal.

## Quirks

[Quirks](Quirks.md) are little things that happen that make your efforts either less effective, or cause wrinkles in your plans. Any dice result of 1 counts as a Quirk (and sometimes higher values count as well). Quirks are normally ignored unless your Quirks exceed your Effort.

If you have more Quirks than you have Effort, something *odd* happens. You still achieve whatever success your Effort would call for, but there's a twist that makes things more interesting. What the twist is can come from the Player who rolled it or the GM; if neither of them has an idea, the other players can make suggestions, but don't spend a lot of time on it - just ignore it and move on.

If you roll *nothing but Quirks*, then you have failed in some spectacular fashion. The failure needs to move the action forward in some way, and can't just be a "whoops, guess you didn't get it!" It can be funny or embarrassing, but it shouldn't be directly harmful or utterly humiliating unless it's the player who rolled all those Quirks's idea.
