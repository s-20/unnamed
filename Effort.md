# Effort

Effort represents how effective you are at what you're trying to do. On a check, each die result of 5 or 6 counts as 1 Effort. You must meet a certain Effort requirement (the Difficulty) in order to fully succeed.

Effort in excess of the Difficulty can be spent on "special effects" - that is, small short-term benefits that will aid you or your allies in the scene, although depending on what you're trying to do, the special effects could actually linger for quite a while. This isn't always a mechanical benefit, but it can be.
