# Effort

Effort represents how effective you are at what you're trying to do. On a check, each die result of 5 or 6 counts as 1 Effort. [You must meet a certain Effort requirement](Challenge.md) in order to fully succeed.

Effort in excess of the Difficulty can be spent on “special effects” — that is, small short-term benefits that will aid you or your allies in the scene, although depending on what you're trying to do, the special effects could actually linger for quite a while. Some things are just sort of binary; you succeed or you don't, and extra flair doesn't really help. In these cases, extra Effort is just good for looking cool.

## Extra Effort

Any successes you get beyond the Difficulty can be spent for Extra Effort benefits, or *Special Effects*. These are little extra benefits that can help you out going forward, or can contribute to the story. A few examples might be:

- When picking a lock, you do it much faster than you originally anticipated. The lock just pops, and you leave no scratches or other marks to tell anyone that the lock's been picked.
- You're disarming a trap, and find you can reset it after your friends get through, impeding the progress of anyone who might be following you, or you recognize a “signature” in the work and know something about who set it
- You don't just fix the car, you optimize the engine and squeeze a few more horses out of the engine; gain +1 Effort in your next car chase!

Any of the above could be gained with just 1 extra effort. You can gain multiple different benefits, or you can combine the extra effort into larger benefits. In [Combat](Combat.md), for instance, 2 extra effort can be spent to deal an extra level of damage. Extra Effort can also be used to power [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), or whatever else you think it should be used for, like:

- **Synergy for a Related Check**: you could apply the additional Effort as [Synergy](Synergy.md) going forward, granting advantages to later checks
- **Opportunities**: The extra effort opens up a new course of action or opportunity to exploit, either now or in the future.
- **Faster, Stronger, Tougher**: The extra effort provides more oomph, allowing you to complete a task more quickly, with more force, or with more enduring results — or a combination of the three. This could mean extra damage in an attack, the ability to make another attack, or a longer duration for a Special Ability.
- **Extra Effect**: Your action was so successful, you can add additional effects to what you were doing — a hacker puts in a backdoor allowing for easier access next time, a martial artist can trip or overrun their opponent, or the client thinks your idea was actually their idea, making them more willing to help.

If there's nothing obvious to be gained from the situation at hand, the extra effort is lost, and you just look cool accomplishing your goal. If you think about it, though, you can usually come up with *something* to do with that extra effort. Be creative!

## Quirks

[Quirks](Quirks.md) are little things that happen that make your efforts either less effective, or cause wrinkles in your plans. Any dice result of 1 counts as a Quirk. Quirks are normally ignored unless your Quirks exceed your Effort.

If you have more Quirks than you have Effort, something *odd* happens. You still achieve whatever success your Effort would call for, but there's a twist that makes things more interesting.

If you roll Quirks, but no Effort, then you've failed in some way. You might still accomplish your goal if it's necessary to move the plot along, but there is some sort of serious drawback or failing in your efforts that may come back to haunt you. In the ever-present lock picking example, perhaps you left obvious scratches on the lock, broke your tools, or caused the whole lock assembly to fall out of the door. Although the failure is obvious to *you*, it may not be known to your character.

If you roll *nothing but Quirks*, then you have failed in some spectacular fashion. The failure needs to move the action forward in some way, and can't just be a “whoops, guess you didn't get it!” It can be funny or embarrassing, but it shouldn't be directly harmful or utterly humiliating unless it's the player's idea.

## Overkill

Rolling lots of dice can be fun, but it can also be unweildy. To reduce the number of dice you have to search for [Effort](Effort.md) when you have lots, use the Overkill rule: You can always trade five dice for 1 Effort, regardless of other circumstances.

You never roll more than 10 dice at a time in any case. Overkill kicks in as soon as you hit 11 dice, converting five to dice into effort. So if you would roll 14 dice for a check, you instead roll 9 dice + 1 Effort. This applies as often as you need it to: if you manage to pull together 23 dice for a check, you would roll 8 dice + 3 Effort, and so on.
