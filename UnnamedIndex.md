## Acknowledgements

I'm going to fix this up eventually. For now, just know that if you've helped me out, I'm grateful. I'm not always good at saying Thank You, but I am always thankful.

## Dumb Side Projects

I get sidetracked easily. I don't have ADD or anything like that, but sometimes I get distracted by a thought, and then an hour later I'm a mile down the rabbit hole chasing Alice across the chessboard (literary mixed metaphors, FTW).

I like game mechanics. I'm fascinated by resolution systems, character creation systems, and combat mechanics, among other things. I like seeing how people handle [stuff you know how to do](Skills.md) verses [general talent](Traits.md) verses [the stuff you're just plain made to do](Aspects.md). I also like seeing how the rules bend themselves into [little pretzels](MetaTraits.md) for [fun stuff](SpecialAbilities.md) that makes each character unique.

I also like creative settings and game setups. I like seeing how people use system to reinforce types of play, and to bolster setting. Now, I'm personally of the opinion that if your rules reinforce the type of play you're after, then all you need for them to reinforce your setting is a coat of paint. Change some names around or something - like the Storypath system ~~does~~ tries to do.

Where was I? Right - rabbit holes. Anyway, sometimes these trips to Wonderland are interesting enough that I want to pursue them a bit. That can mean delving into some mechanics, or marrying some piece of a game to some narrative goal, or ideas that might fit into a different game, or a variety of other things.

If you've read this far, I can only assume you like my content for one reason or another, even if it's just schadenfreude. So, I'm making this section to tell you why there's stuff on this wiki that has little to nothing to do with the unnamed System.

You can find that stuff in the [Side Stuff Index](SSIndex.md). There you'll find all the little musings of mine that I want to share, but don't fit into the unnamed Wiki.

I work on stuff like this to clear my head of things that don't fit in the main project. There might be homebrewed content for other systems, setting ideas, or mechanics for a different homemade game entirely.

I'm including this so that I have a place to go to look at it, where these ideas are backed up until I decide I hate them and they should go away. I'm also putting them here because I thought other people might be curious as to the kind of dumbass crap that runs through my head sometimtes.

I can promise that it's all TTRPG related. I can promise that, at a minimum, *I* think it's interesting. That's not a promise that you will, but I hope you do.

If you're just here for the unnamed system, don't bother with this stuff - it has nothing to do with that.
