# unnamed Role Playing System

?> A flexible pen and paper RPG - alpha ready, kinda!

unnamed is a tabletop role playing game designed to be adaptable to any genre (rather than "universal"). The features we're going for include:

- a basic success-based dice resolution system
- character concept driven character creation
- adaptability
- Tactical or Abstract combat, as you prefer
- Shared narrative responsibility
- Streamlined GMing

It's a work in progress, but feel free to let me know what you think. For the record, it's not *called* "unnamed," I just haven't settled on a name.
