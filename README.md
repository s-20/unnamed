# unnamed Role Playing System

?> A flexible pen and paper RPG - WIP

unnamed is a tabletop role-playing game designed to be adaptable to any genre. The features we're going for include:

- a basic success-based dice resolution system
- character concept driven character creation
- Tactical or Abstract combat, as you prefer
- Shared narrative responsibility
- Streamlined GMing

It's a work in progress, but feel free to let me know what you think.
