# Complications

Complications are the little things in a character's life that make it more... interesting. Complications are called into service to add complexity or intrigue to a plot, to connect the character to the world they're in, and to add [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) to the pool.

## Gaining Complications

Generally, Complications can be added to a character in two ways - either as part of character creation or through game play as part of the story. Complications added during character creation are part of a character's history. Whether recent developments or things present since birth, they've had an effect on the character already.

Complications gained during the game (after the inital adjustment period) are caused by events *in* game. Trauma can add a new phobia or PTSD, for example. However the Complications are gained, they operate the same way.

## Making Complications

Complications are player defined, but can be roughly broken down into a few groups:

- **Loved Ones** - people you care about - often, but not always, also a [Connection](Connections.md)
- **Struggles** - difficulties like Use Disorders, severe allergies, mood disorders, and so on that the character struggled/lives with
- **Disability** - physical disabilities, like unavailable senses, missing limbs, etc.
- **Phobias and Philias** - phobias or perfectly reasonable fears that a character has to a disabling degree, or specific obsessions, sexual or otherwise, that the character has
- **Adversaries** - a broad term that includes everything from people that want the character dead to people who just get off on making their life tougher - enemies, frenemies, and so on
- **Duties** - Obligations to others that have severe consequences if broken
- **Codes** - personal or organizational commitments to codes of conduct like pacifism, chivalry, or a college's Code of Conduct
- **Stigma** - You belong to a group that is poorly treated by society in some specific way

Don't take a Complication if you don't want it to come up in game. For example, don't take "My sister Kate" as a Complication unless you want your sister directly involved in things occasionally.

Good Complications are like good [Aspects](Aspects.md) in that they can be broken down into a single sentence, phrase, or even one word. Players should use the above categories to help them sort out their own Complications that work into character [Origins](Origin.md) and histories.

### Complication Examples

- My beloved sister, Kate, who is a local nurse
- Alcohol Use Disorder
- Severe Depression with Psychotic Features
- Lost my right eye in a slingshot accident as a kid
- Folks don't trust Kobolds
- Deathly allergic to tree nuts
- Dendrophobia (an irrational fear of trees)
- Ailurophilia (crazy cat person)
- McMasters, my former partner, wants me dead
- I've sworn fealty to the Queen of the Hedge
- I live by the unspoken Superhero's Code - no killing, no guns, protect the innocent even at the cost of my own life, etc.

## Applying Complications

When you're in a situation where your Complications could make a scene better, role play it. You can add consequences as well; for example, maybe you burn a Trait to resist an addiction.

Characters don't have to be ruled by their complications, just that they can make life more interesting or difficult.

Other players and the GM can call your Complications into a scene as well; if you have an Adversary, the GM can work them into the plot. If you don't notice that your character is ignoring one of their phobias, another player can call it out.

In any case, whenever one of your Complications makes things more difficult or adds to the story, 1 [Drama Die](DramaDice) is added to the pool.

## Pulling Complications

Some complications can actually provide you benefits. Loved Ones can be asked for favors like a [Connection](Connections.md) (although they may not be reliable unles they're also a Connection). An honor code might give you strength when it's put to the test. A shared disorder can be a way to open up a dialogue.

When you find yourself in a situation like this, you can pull a Complication for a check, gaining a die for the check. You cannot [Burn](Burn.md) a Complication.
