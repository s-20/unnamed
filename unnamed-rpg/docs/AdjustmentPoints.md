# Adjustment Points

Adjustment Points are used to make modifications to a character, either during [Character Creation](CCSummary.md) or during [Advancement](Advancement.md). With the exception of new or improved [Connections](Connections.md), Adjustment Points are used the same way whether you are creating a character or advancing a character.

During Character Creation, you are awarded 15 Adjustment Points to modify your character. When you get an Advancement, you can choose either 5 or 10 additional Adjustment Points.

## Making Adjustments

Adjustment points can be spent on a variety of different things. Different Adjustments have different costs, ranging from 10 Adjustment Points down to 1.

Each section below describes the costs and benefits for spending Adjustment Points. Although all changes should be discussed with the GM, the player is meant to have a lot of latitude here.

### 10 Adjustment Points

For 10 points, you can:

- **Improve an Aspect**: Increase the Stack of an Aspect by 1.
- **Add a New Aspect**: You can add an additional Aspect. Characters cannot have more Aspects than [Tier +1](Advancement.md).
- **Improve Wound Threshold**: Increase your Wound Threshold by 1. Characters are usually limited to 5 + [Tier x2](Advancement.md).
- **Improve an Energy [Trait](Traits.md)**: Make an [Energy [Trait](Traits.md)](Energy[Trait](Traits.md)s.md) charge faster

### 8 Adjustment Points

If your campaign has [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), it costs 8 Adjustment points to gain an additional one, if it's available at all. All modifications to Special Abilities must be made with GM discussion and approval.

### 5 Adjustment Points

For 5 Adjustment Points, you can: 

- **Improve a [Trait](Traits.md) or Skill**: Increase the stack of an existing [Trait](Traits.md) or Skill by 1. [Traits](Traits.md) are usually capped at a stack of 5, Skills at a stack of [3 + Tier](Advancement.md).
- **Add a New [Trait](Traits.md)**: If it seems appropriate, you can add a new [Trait](Traits.md) with a stack of 1. New [Traits](Traits.md) should usually be gained after something happens in the story to trigger it.
- **Expand a Special Ability**: If you have a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md) with a list of sub-abilities, like Magic or Psychic Power, you can expand that power (gain new spells, for instance) for 5 Adjustment Points.

### 2 Adjustment Points

For 2 Adjustment Points, you can:

- **Improve a Connection**: Increase the stack of a [Connection](Connections.md) by 1. You cannot spend Adjustment Points like this during [Advancement](Advancement.md).
- **Gain a New Connection**: Add a new [Connection](Connections.md). You cannot spend Adjustment Points like this during [Advancement](Advancement.md).

### 1 Adjustment Point

For 1 Adjustment Point, you can:

- **Add a Detail**: You can add a new [Detail](Details.md) if it makes sense to do so.
- **Improve Energy Capacity**: Improve your [Energy Capacity](Energy.md) by 1 for one [Energy Pool](Energy.md). Energy Pools are generally capped at [5x Tier](Advancement.md)

## Holding Off

You don't have to spend all of your Adjustment Points as soon as you get them. This is another place where points gained through Character Creation are treated differently from those gained during Advancement.

Adjustment Points gained through [Character Creation](CCSummary.md) can be spent at any time - even during play. This is so that you can make minor changes to your character as you get a better feel for both the campaign and how the character deals with adversity.

Adjustment Points gained through [Advancement](Advancement.md) can only be spent between game sessions, but they can be held onto for as long as you like, up until you advance to a new Tier.

Adjustment Points not spent before the start of the first session on the new Tier are converted into [Perks](MarksPerks.md) at a rate of 5 Adjustment Points to 1 Perk; as always, round up (so 1 unused Adjustment Point would become 1 Perk, 7 would be 2 Perks, and so on).

## Character Creation: What's Next

At this stage in [Character Creation](CCSummary.md), you're more or less done. Finalize your [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold) and any [Energy Pools](Energy.md) you might have, then fill in any quirks or peccadillos that help round out your character, and get ready to play!
