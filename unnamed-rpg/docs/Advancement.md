# Advancement

As the campaign continues, your character will get better at things. This is primarily accomplished through Advancements and Tiers.

In addition to Advancements, characters can be improved through Awards. Awards are special improvements or modifications granted to a character during play due to the events of the story.

## Advancements

 Characters should usually gain an Advancement every other session, with an extra one when some significant plot point is resolved. How often characters will get Advancements should be established or at least discussed when you establish [Parameters](Parameters.md) for your campaign.

 Advancements are used to improve your character's abilities. All Advancements should be spent before the next session begins, otherwise they cannot be spent until that session ends (no Advancements spent mid-session, and no making people wait for you to level up after game starts).

To spend an Advancement, select one option from the list below. Each option may only be selected once; once all the options have been selected, the character goes up a Tier (see below) and the available Advancements are reset.

### Advancement Options

- Increase a [Trait](Traits.md)'s Stack by 1
- Increase a [Skill](Skills.md)'s Stack by 1
- Increase [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md) by 1
- Gain 5 [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md)
- Gain 10 [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md)

If there is some character reason why you don't want to use one of these (for instance, you don't want to increase your Wound Threshold because your character is supposed to be frail), you can convert an Advancement to a [Perk](MarksPerks.md), and mark off the advancement as if you had used it. You can't do this with either of the Adjustment Point options, but the other three are up for grabs.

### Gaining a Tier

Once you've selected each of the options above once, your character goes up a Tier. When a character goes up a Tier, the following happens:

- Select an [Aspect](Aspects.md). That Aspect's Stack is improved by 1. If appropriate, you may add a new Aspect instead with GM approval
- Make any needed adjustments to your [Origin](Origin.md)
- Gain 15 [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md)
- Reset available Advancement Options
- Talk to your GM about any changes that might need to be made to Special Abilities or Connections for the new Tier of play

Tier Gains do not need to be take care of as soon as they happen. In general, they should be resolved when the characters get a chance to rest or recuperate, and reflect on their recent experiences.

Even if they don't gain Advancements at the same rate, Tier Gains should be resolved for all characters in a group at the same time. It is appropriate to spend a session taking care of Tier Advancement changes to characters, or maybe an hour or so at the beginning or end of a session.

Once all characters have gone up a Tier, two [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) are added to the pool.

## Awards

An Award is an improvement to the character gained through role play. Awards are how you improve [Connections](Connections.md), along with some [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md).

Awards are generally gained through good role play, adding interesting things to the story, and especially creative ideas. Although just about anything can be given as an Award, the most common Awards are outlined below.

### Connection Awards

You can gain new Connections or improve existing ones through role play. Any time a player thinks their connections have gotten stronger, or they've developed a new one, they can ask the GM for a Connection Award. Alternately, if the GM thinks the Connection has ben strengthened, or a new connection has been forged, they can just award it to the player.

Connections are much more dynamic than any other characteristic, in that they are much more prone to changes in stack, gains, and loss - a Connection can be gained, increase its stack, and be lost all in one story arc - or even in one scene!

### Special Ability Awards

In the Unnamed System, [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) are broadly defined, and are often left open ended. This is intentional. For one thing it's a lot easier to say "I have Spider Powers, and they manifest in this way" than it is to rigorously define each aspect of what "Spider Powers" means.

For another thing, this makes it easier to expand the abilities when story and experience require. Maybe your once device-dependent webs are now organic and produced by you. Or maybe your new alien costume (that will never, ever cause problems for you in the future) enhances your strength.

Special Ability awards occur when it's story appropriate: something in the narrative has to have triggered them. They can take a variety of forms; an increase in an [Energy Pool](Energy.md), an expansion of an existing ability, more "spells", et al.

You might get a Special Ability Award by using your power in a cool new way, because you found a spellbook, because you're on a planet with a blue sun, or any of a variety of other circumstances. Often these changes will be permanent; sometimes they will only last a session or two.
