# Character Creation

Creating characters in unnamed isn’t a difficult process, but it can be an involved one. Put as plainly as possible, you come up with a concept in line with the campaign’s [Paramters](Parameters.md), choose a few [Characteristics](Characteristics.md), and determine what significant [Stuff](Stuff.md) your character has. If you have some sort of [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md), you also work that out with your GM and your Game Group. Done.

This section goes into detail on the process, breaking things down into steps and explaining each step in detail. In the process, we’re going to also look at some basic mechanics and system conciets.

## Character Concept

The first step in any character creation process for any tabletop roe playing game is to come up with a character concept - an idea of the character you want to play in the game. There are lots of ways to do this, but there are two main categories of concept creation - Guided Creation and Freeform Creation. Either group, however, requires setting up some expectations for the upcoming story. In the unnamed system, we call this Parameters.

### Parameters

Although the main article for Parameters can be found [here](Parameters.md), it’s worth going over how the directy impact character creation. Parameters are the framework of a given story. They involve general expectations, like scale, genre, setting, and so on. They also involve specific expectations of content, establishing safe topic matter, and getting everyone on the same page for the game.

Parameters are generally established with an open game group discussion. During this discussion, the group goes over the broad strokes of the upcoming game as described above, but in the context of Character Creation, the most important thing parameters do is tell you what sort of characters the group is going to play. The parameters of the campaign let you know if you’re going to be struggling survivors in a post apocolypse, superheroes, fantasy adventurers on a series of increasingly dangerous quests, or traders navigating a dangerous galaxy full of space pirates and hostile aliens.

Parameters also establish tone, which is vital in generating a character concept. Tone, in its simplest form, is how seriously you’re taking things in the game. A game might be goofy, deadly serious, or anything in between. As you move forward developing your character concept, keep the tone in mind. Your character idea for Frippy Jim McNippleton the Juggler might have a place in a goofy game set in a magical circus, but will be wildly out of place and disruptive in a grim zombie apocalypse. It *is* more about how you handle it than anything else, but some ideas might be happier in a different game.

## Choose Characteristics

Once you have a concept and perhaps some guided (or unguided) character history, you need to choose your Characteristics. These are the primary mechanical choices you make for your character that form the backbone of your character. Characteristics in unnamed are *descriptive* - that is to say, reading the characteristics on a sheet should readily give you an idea of what the character is about.

There are four main Characteristics in a character:

- [Aspects](Aspects.md) - major things that define your character in broad strokes and are tied into their identiy - both how they perceive themselves and how they are perceived by others.
- [Traits](Traits.md) - Broad talents or abilities, like how strong, fast, or charismatic a character is.
- [Skills](Skills.md) - Things a character knows how to do, through natural talent or training.
- [Connections](Connections.md) - Ways in which the character is tied to the world around them - people they know and care about (or hate), significant events they were involved in or present for, organizations they belong to (or aspire to belong to), and so on.

There are also a few other Characteristics that we’ll be discussing later:

- [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) - Typically superhuman abilities the character can exploit during the game, like super powers, magical training, psychic ability, or cybernetic implants. Not all games will use Special Abilities.
- [Details](Details.md) - Little things that can be helpful or harmful to a character when they show up, but aren’t generally significant to their day to day life. Character’s don’t *need* Details, but they can help flesh out some concepts.
- [Tangles](Tangles.md) - Things about a character that make their life more difficult. Tangles can also come in handy upon occasion.
- [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md) - The character’s ability to survive injury. Although all characters use WOund Thresholds, they don’t actually change much from character to character most of the time.
- [Energy](Energy.md) - A character’s connection to the sources of “energy” in a setting; Energy is a subset of SPecial Abilities. If you’re not using Special Abilities, you probably don’t need to worry about Energy.

A starting character gets two Aspects, and a pool of 20 Ranks to divide among Traits, Skills, and Connections. Other Characteristics are handled separately.

### Aspects

Aspects are specific to each character. It’s a short phrase, usually less than five words, describing major areas of expertise, concepts, or other things important to a character. Some examples might include *Damn Good Pilot*, *Elfish Bladesinger*, *Smuggler with Connections*, *Professor of Archaeology at Miskatonic Collage in Arkham*, or *Genetically Enhanced Supersoldier*. In other game systems, Aspects might be represented by Character Classes, “Races”, Heritage, or other similar broad concepts.

Your character starts with two Aspects chosen and defined by you. Aspects should be straightforward and easy to interpret. They should be flexible as well, and apply to a number of situations, but not be so broad they apply to **every** situation. 

If your parameters establish that there are non-human options for characters, and you elect to have such a character, at least one Aspect should involve the alternative Heritage (or whatever) in some way. For example, if your campaign has Androids as a possible character option, then at least one Aspect of an Android character should note this fact, but should also have some additional information. *Android* isn’t a good Aspect, but *Android Science Officer* is. *Hill Dwarf* isn’t enough, but *Apprentice Hill Dwarf Blacksmith* works well.

**At this step** ⇒ Choose and Define two Aspects.

### Traits

Traits are chosen from a list found [here](Traits.md) and take the form of Adjectives that describe a character’s broad abilities. If your character has a similar sort of core ability that is different from those on the list, you can create a new Trait, as long as you discuss it with the game group or at least your GM so that everyone knows what it represents. For example, if you don’t like saying your character is Strong, you could say Wiry and indicate that it’s less about broad physical power and more about knowing how to use your prowess in an effective way.

You get 20 ranks to put between Traits, Skills, and Connections. It’s a good idea to make sure you use at least 5 Ranks distributed among at least three different Traits, but this isn’t a requirement. You can put more than one rank in a single trait, representing greater ability, but keep in mind that even one rank indicates above average ability - average would be not having ranks in the trait at all.

**At this step** ⇒ Put some of your 20 Characteristic ranks into Traits, trying for a minimum of 3 different traits and 5 ranks overall.

### Skills

Skills are composed of two words - an Adjective that describes what you know how to do and a Noun that describes what you know how to do it to. For example, if your character is good in a fight at close range, you might take ranks in the skill “Close Combat”. You can define skills yourself using this formula, or you can choose from the list found [here](Skills.md).

You get 20 ranks to put between Traits, Skills, and Connections. It’s a good idea to have at least 3 different skills and to put at least 5 ranks into Skills overall. There are special sub-skills that represent specialties in more closely defined areas called; this is called a Focus. If you have more than one rank in a single skill, you get a free Focus for that skill. You can take additional Foci for any skill with more than one rank at the cost of 1 Focus per Rank. You can’t put more than one rank in a single Focus, but you can have as many Foci for a given skill as you’d like.

**At this step** ⇒ Put some of your 20 Characteristic ranks into Skills, trying for a minimum of 3 different Skills and 5 ranks overall. Add a Focus to any Skill with more than one rank.

### Connections

Connections are single words or short phrases describing people, events, property, or other things related to your character that tie them to the setting. Some examples might include *My sister Kate, the Medical Examiner for Cass Perish*, *Veteran of the Balkan Conflict*, *Active in the local LGBTQ Outreach*, or *Owns a nice house in Skokie*. You usually define your own connections, but in some games there might be a specific list of common Connections - for instance, in a game with warring factions, there might be a list of factions you can be a member of.

You get 20 ranks to put between Traits, Skills, and Connections. It’s a good idea to have at least 5 different connections, although this isn’t a requirement. Having a Connection with another player’s character can help facilitate the start of a game, but since all characters are assumed to eventually be “connected”, this is only useful if the relationship is strong or unusual.

**At this step** ⇒ Put some of your 20 Characteristic ranks into Connections, trying for a minimum of 5 different Connections.

### Other Characteristics

The following Characteristics may or may not appear in every game, or may not be modifyable during character creation, meaning that they’ll be the same on every character. Either way, they are a bit unusual compare to the primary four characteristics, and none of them draw from your 20 Characteristic Ranks.

#### Special Abilities (Optional)

Special Abilities represent (typically superhuman or supernatural) abilities that your character has access to. Special Abilites are often loosely defined, but the important point for this article is that all characters in a given game have the same potential *acess* to special abilities, which are of the same scale.

Check the [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) page for details.

#### Details

Details represent little things - personal quirks or affectations, bits of minor background, and other stuff that fills in the cracks and makes a character more complete. You can have as many as you’d like to start with, but it’s better to take a couple and then fill in more as the game goes on. Details can sometimes provide [Synergy](Synergy.md), but such occurances are generally rare. Mostly they’re here for role playing putposes/

Check the [Details](Detais.md) page for more… er… details.

#### Tangles

Tangles are things that make your life a bit more difficult, or are otherwise drawbacks. They can be things like addictions, potentially deadly allergies (annoying allergies are more like Details), physical limitations (color blindness, having only one leg, asthma, etc.), psychological or mood disorders (clinical depression, phobias, use disorder, antisocial personality disorder), social/cultural complications, Enemies, outstanding warrants, or anything else that can come up occasionally to make things more challenging.

Take a few Tangles to start, but no more than five or six. You can put more than one rank in an individual Tangle if it is especially onerous or intense. In a longer campaign, You can also wait and see what fits best with your character after you start, adding in a few Tangles in the first two or three sessions of play. See the [Tangles](Tangles.md) page for more details.

#### Wound Threshold

Wound Threshold is more like a “stat” than a Characteristic most of the time. All characters can sustain a certain number of wounds (by default 3) before succumbing to unconsciousness or severe debilitation. Further Wounds can result in death.

Your Wound Threshold also notes Scars (permanent or long-term effects from being wounded) and the details of your specific Wounds. There are other things, however, that can go in this group, like special resistances/immunity and the details of any protective gear you’re wearing.

See the [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md) page for more details.

**At this step** ⇒ Note your Wound Threshold on your sheet, leaving room for notes on specific wounds and scars.

#### Energy

In games that have Special Abilities, those abilities may be fueled by Energy: Stamina, Mana, Momentum, and other examples. A single ability may have different uses tied to different forms of energy. Even in games without SPecial Abilities, an Energy source like Stamina might allow for extra effort on physical checks.

Discuss Energy with your GM and Game Group. Determining what you have access to in the way of energy is a big part of setting Parameters and building your Special Abilities. See the [Energy](Energy.md) page for more details.

### Stuff

Stuff is all about your possessions. Although big property or something like being very wealthy are handled with Aspects or Connections, other things are more or less “free” during character creation. What is and isn’t available is up to the GM and should be established (or at least hinted at) in Parameters, but generally things like clothes, mundane weapons or armor, a reasonable amount of cash on hand, and a place to live are all Stuff you just have. You can also just have anything that’s generally accepted to be a part of life in the setting you’re using. For instance, in a modern game set in an industrialized nation, you can probably have a smart phone, internet wherever you live, and maybe even a car or other transportation if that would be normal for where the story takes place (in Des Moines, probably, in New York, maybe not).

unnamed doesn’t do a lot of accounting. Your character can be assumed to have access to a reasonable amount of stuff, with a reasonable amount of middle-class wealth, provided that’s what’s established in the Parameters. You have some cash on hand, and some credit if that makes sense too. If you have *a lot* of money/property/income/credit, that’s going to cost you a Connection or - if you’re basically Bruce Wayne - an Aspect. If you’re poorer than whatever the parameters establish as average, that’s good for a Complication.

Either way, you don’t need to make or track an extensive equipment list. Note the really important stuff (important mechanically, like special weapons/armor, or exceptional tools, and important personally, like your locket with a picture of your dead husband), mention where you’re living and where your normal income comes from. After that, you have what it would be reasonable for you to have. If you’re out on andventure and you need a screwdriver, and it would make sense for your character to be carrying one (because she’s a carpenter or something), then she has one. Otherwise, she’s going to have to find one.

See [Stuff](Stuff.md) for more details.

**At this step** ⇒ Establish the most important Stuff you have, where you live, how you make your living. Take notes, and then be reasonable.

### Finishing Touches

Go through your character at this point and make sure you’ve taken all your available Characteristic Ranks, noted your Aspects, grabbed any Stuff you think is important, and so on. Then, discussing with your GM and going over your decisions, see if there aren’t any adjustments you’d like to make, or some Details or Complications you’d like to add before you get started. 

If you haven’t done it yet, give your character a name, physical description, and decide their gender, gender identity, sexuality, and other things to get them more firmly in your mind. Your GM or other Players may have a few questions for you to help them get a better idea of the character you’re playing, and perhaps their role in the larger group or the story.

After all this, if you’re satisfied with how things have come out, you’re ready to go!
