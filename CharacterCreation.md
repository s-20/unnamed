# Character Creation

Creating characters in unnamed isn’t a difficult process. In short, you come up with a concept in line with the campaign’s [Paramters](Parameters.md), choose a few [Characteristics](Characteristics.md), and determine what significant [Stuff](Stuff.md) your character has. If you have some sort of [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md), you also work that out with your GM and your Game Group. Done.

This section goes into detail on the process, breaking things down into steps and explaining each step in detail. In the process, we‘re going to also look at some basic mechanics and system conceits.

## Character Creation Summary

To make a character in unnamed, use the following process. Each step is explained in detail below.

1. **Concept**: Come up with a character concept in line with campaign [Parameters](Parameters.md)
2. **Characteristics**: Put two ranks into [Aspects](Aspects.md) and 20 ranks divided between [Traits](Traits.md), [Skills](Skills.md), and [Connections](Connections.md)
3. **Statistics**: Determine [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), [Energy](Energy.md), [Details](Details.md), [Tangles](Tangles.md), and [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md) and [Stuff](Stuff.md)
4. **Finishing Touches**

## Character Concept

The first step in any character creation process for any tabletop role-playing game is to come up with a character concept — an idea of the character you want to play in the game. There are lots of ways to do this, but there are two main categories of concept creation — Guided Creation and Free Form Creation. Either group, however, requires setting up some expectations for the upcoming story.

### Guided Creation

With a Guided creation, players come together either as a complete group or one on one with their GM, and answer a series of questions about their characters before they pick any characteristics. The GM may have a ready list of these questions, or you might go around the table asking each other leading questions to help establish character backgrounds, abilities, and connections to one another and the world around them.

During Guided creation, you can select your Characteristics as you go, building your character gradually until you run out of ranks to distribute (see below). This method allows you to create characters more organically, and can help the group cement the Parameters of the campaign in their heads.

A few sample questions for a guided development might be:

- You moved to Chicago within the last month. Why did you come?
- Who are (or were) your parents? Do you have siblings?
- Talk about an event in your past when you faced adversity, prejudice, or deadly danger.
- Do you know any of the other characters? If so, how do you know each other?
- Tell us about an NPC in your life.
- What is your greatest skill? How did you learn how to do that?
- Share an odd detail about your character - something eccentric or unusual that makes them unique.
- How does your character dress? Are they slobs, fastidious, or somewhere in between? Do they keep up with fashions, or are they more of the T-shirt and Jeans sort?
- Describe one exceptional physical attribute concerning your character.
- Name one thing your character loves, and one thing they hate.

Any of these or other questions can be discussed well beyond a simple answer. For example, if asked who your parents are, don‘t just say “Bob and Linda”. Talk about what they do (or did) for a living, how you get along with them if they‘re still around, and so on.

### Free Form Creation

Free Form Creation is a bit more direct. After establishing Parameters, everyone gets their 20 Ranks to distribute and you go. You can (and should) still discuss your characters as you make them, of course, but there‘s no guided conversation to bring out details. This method is good for when you want to get a quick start, or when people have a difficulties finding time to get together.

## [Aspects](Aspects.md) (2 Ranks)

Aspects are specific to each character. It‘s a short phrase, usually less than five words, describing major areas of expertise, concepts, or other things important to a character. Some examples might include *Damn Good Pilot*, *Elfish Blade-singer*, *Smuggler with Connections*, *Professor of Archaeology at Miskatonic Collage in Arkham*, or *Genetically Enhanced Super Soldier*. In other game systems, Aspects might be represented by Character Classes, “Races”, Heritage, or other similar broad concepts.

Your character starts with two ranks of Aspects chosen and defined by you. Having two different Aspects is probably the best idea, but you can put both ranks in one Aspect if you prefer. Aspects should be straightforward and easy to interpret. They should be flexible as well, and apply to a number of situations, but not be so broad they apply to **every** situation.

If your parameters establish that there are non-human options for characters, and you elect to have such a character, at least one Aspect should involve the alternative Heritage (or whatever) in some way. For example, if your campaign has Androids as a possible character option, then at least one Aspect of an Android character should note this fact, but should also have some additional information. *Android* isn‘t a good Aspect, but *Android Science Officer* is. *Hill Dwarf* isn‘t enough, but *Apprentice Hill Dwarf Blacksmith* works well.

## [Traits](Traits.md), [Skills](Skills.md), and [Connections](Connections.md) (20 Ranks)

You get 20 Ranks to divide between the following groups of Characteristics. Try for at least three of each type, and should put at least 5 ranks into each group. Characteristics are limited to no more than 5 ranks during character creation.

**[Traits](Traits.md)** are chosen from a list found [here](Traits.md) and take the form of Adjectives that describe a character‘s broad abilities. If your character has a similar sort of core ability that is different from those on the list, you can create a new Trait, as long as you discuss it with the game group or at least your GM so that everyone knows what it represents.

**[Skills](Skills.md)** are composed of two words — an Adjective that describes what you know how to do and a Noun that describes what you know how to do it to. You can define skills yourself using this formula, or you can choose from the list found [here](Skills.md).

**[Connections](Connections.md)** are single words or short phrases describing people, events, property, or other things related to your character that tie them to the setting. Some examples might include *My sister Kate, the Medical Examiner for Cass Perish*, *Veteran of the Balkan Conflict*, *Active in the local LGBTQ+ Outreach*, or *Owns a house in the South of Grand neighborhood*.

> **Extra Aspects**: You can trade 2 Characteristic Ranks for 1 Aspect rank. You can have up to three Aspects with up to 2 ranks each at the start of the game.

## Statistics

Statistics are parts of a character that aren't Characteristics. They describe special powers the character might have, little details about the character, special challenges a character faces, and their ability to maintain structural integrity (that is, how much harm they can suffer before collapsing or dying), and the things they own or have regular access to.

Each of the Statistic uses its own rules, and is determined here. Statistics aren't usually affected by Characteristics directly, and don't use your Characteristic Ranks.

### Special Abilities

Special Abilities represent (typically superhuman or supernatural) abilities that your character has access to. These are often loosely defined, allowing for flexible interpretation during game. All characters in a given game have the same potential *access* to special abilities, which are of the same scale.

In games that have Special Abilities, those abilities may be fueled by [Energy](Engagement.md). A single ability may have different uses tied to different forms of energy. Even in games without formal Special Abilities, an Energy source.

Check the [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) and [Energy](Energy.md) pages for details. If there are Special Abilities, all characters get the same potential for them, but the way you define yours might be very different from how other players do.

### Details

Details represent little things; personal quirks or affectations, bits of minor background, and other stuff that fills in the cracks and makes a character more complete. You can have as many as you‘d like to start with, but it‘s better to take a couple and then fill in more as the game goes on. Details can sometimes provide [Synergy](Synergy.md).

Check the [Details](Detais.md) page for more… er… details.

### Tangles

Tangles are things that make your life a bit more difficult, or are otherwise drawbacks. They can be things like addictions, potentially deadly allergies (annoying allergies are more like Details), physical limitations (color blindness, having only one leg, asthma, etc.), psychological or mood disorders (clinical depression, phobias, use disorder, antisocial personality disorder), social/cultural complications, Enemies, outstanding warrants, or anything else that can come up occasionally to make things more challenging.

Tangles are optional, but help restore [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) during the game. You can put more than one rank in an individual Tangle if it is especially onerous or intense. In a longer campaign, You can also wait and see what fits best with your character after you start, adding in a few Tangles in the first two or three sessions of play. See the [Tangles](Tangles.md) page for more details.

Note any Tangles you have on your sheet. Try to keep it under 5 different Tangles.

### Wound Threshold

Wounds represent serious physical, mental, or emotional trauma a character goes through. Most of the time, getting hurt will involve burning off Characteristics, but characters often live very dangerous lives. A Wound is no joking matter, and comes with penalties and the potential for [Scars](Scars.md). Too many wounds can take a character permanently out of action — coma, death, or perhaps even worse.

Your Wound Threshold indicates how many Wounds you can sustain before you are in serious risk of death (or worse). It also indicates any particular resistances you have to damage, or any special vulnerabilities, and it's where you track things like armor. Basically, anything dealing with how vulnerable or resistant you are to different sorts of harm is listed here on your character sheet. Your Wound Threshold also notes [Scars](Scars.md) (permanent or long-term effects from being wounded) and the details of your specific Wounds.

All characters can sustain a certain number of wounds (by default 3) before succumbing to unconsciousness or severe debilitation. Wounds beyond this Threshold can result in death.

See the [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md) page for more details.

### Stuff

Stuff is all about your possessions. Although big property or something like being very wealthy are handled with Aspects or Connections, other things are more or less “free” during character creation. 

What is and isn‘t available is up to the GM and should be established (or at least hinted at) in Parameters, but generally things like clothes, mundane weapons or armor, a reasonable amount of cash on hand, and a place to live are all Stuff you just have. You can also just have anything that‘s generally accepted to be a part of life in the setting you‘re using. For instance, in a modern game set in an industrialized nation, you can probably have a smartphone, internet wherever you live, and maybe even a car or other transportation if that would be normal for where and when the story takes place.

unnamed doesn‘t do a lot of accounting. Your character can be assumed to have access to a reasonable amount of stuff, with a reasonable amount of middle-class wealth, provided that‘s what‘s established in the Parameters. You have some cash on hand, and some credit if that makes sense too. If you have *a lot* of money/property/income/credit, that‘s going to cost you a Connection or (if you‘re basically Bruce Wayne or Tony Tark) an Aspect. If you‘re poorer than whatever the parameters establish as average, that‘s a possible Tangle.

Either way, you don‘t need to make or track an extensive equipment list. Note the really important stuff (important mechanically, like special weapons/armor, or exceptional tools, and important personally, like your locket with a picture of your dead husband), mention where you‘re living and where your normal income comes from. After that, you have what it would be reasonable for you to have. If you‘re out on an adventure and you need a screwdriver, and it would make sense for your character to be carrying one (because she‘s a mechanic or something), then she has one. Otherwise, she‘s going to have to find one.

See [Stuff](Stuff.md) for more details.

## Finishing Touches

Go through your character at this point and make sure you‘ve taken all your available Characteristic Ranks, noted your Aspects, grabbed any Stuff you think is important, and so on. Then, discuss with your GM/Group and go over your decisions. See if there aren‘t any adjustments you‘d like to make, or some Details or Tangles you‘d like to add before you get started.

If you haven‘t done it yet, give your character a name, physical description, and decide their physical gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, and other things to get them more firmly in your mind. Your GM or other Players may have a few questions for you to help them get a better idea of the character you‘re playing, and perhaps their role in the larger group or the story.

After all this, if you‘re satisfied with how things have come out, you‘re ready to go!
