# Perks

Perks are special rewards gained for good roleplaying, primarily from facing your [Complications](Complications.md) or making sacrifices for your group. Perks are a powerful meta-tool that you can use to affect the story in your character's favor. They also operate as a secondary experience track, granting you an [Advancement](Advancement.md) for every 10 Perks you spend in game.

## Using Perks

Perks can be put to a variety of uses. From making re-rolls to dodging death to fueling [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), perks have many uses.

The simplest use of Perks is to provide a re-roll to a Check - if you don't like the results of a check, you can spend a Perk to re-roll it. You can then take whichever result you prefer.

Other uses for perks are outlined below.

### Saving Yourself

You can spend a perk to save yourself from harm or overcome your current condition in several ways:

- **Damage Reduction** - Whenever a character would receive one or more [Wounds](WoundThreshold.md), you may spend a Perk to reduce the damage by 1. If this reduces the damage to 0, explain how you avoided the damage (it was a glancing blow, I twisted at the last second, the blade hit the bible in my pocket, etc.). You can spend more than one perk on a single attack, reducing even massive damage to 0 if you have enough Perks.
- **Suspend a Condition** - You can spend a Perk to suspend a [Condition](Conditions.md), allowing you to act as though you don't have it or otherwise avoid its effects until the end of the scene, or longer if the story demands it. The suspended Condition is still with you, and affects you in a role playing sense, but doesn't affect your checks or characteristics.
- **Recover from a Condition** - Some Conditions can be completely removed with a Perk. This is reserved for Conditions that have brief durations and/or no lasting ill effects, or that it makes sense to be able to throw off. For example, a Bleeding character might spend a Perk to stop their bleeding, but a Dying character couldn't spend a Perk to stop dying.

### Altering the Scene

Perks can be used in a manner similar to [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) to alter a scene, except that the alteration must be specific to your character in some way. You happen to have a tool you need, the Guard shares one of your Connections, or you find the right key on the ring first try.

You can also alter the scene to avoid dealing with one of your Complications without specifically ignoring it - for example, say a character with alcohol use disorder comes across a study that has a nice crystal decanter full of what looks like scotch. The player spends a Perk, and goes in for a drink - only to discover that it's iced tea.

### Fueling Special Abilities

Perks can be used as emergency [Energy](Energy.md) for Exploits or other parts of a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md). The way this works depends on the type of energy pool you have. A Perk can activate any single exploit based on a spendable or charging pool, can add 1 Momentum to your total, or can push you to a Breaking Point. Other energy resources can be affected in a similar way.

### Trading for Drama Dice

At the end of a session, you can trade in one or more perk for [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md). You can trade as many as you like, up to the campaign's maximum Drama DIce pool.

Drama Dice are available to everyone, and perks are only available to you, so trading in Perks this way can help out the group. Moreover, Drama Dice are generally more versatile and powerful than Perks.
