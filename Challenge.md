# Challenge

Challenge represents how hard something is to accomplish, and represents how much [Effort](Effort.md) you need to generate to fully succeed. Overcoming the Challenge of a check isn't always a requirement for success. Challenge might be straight-up difficulty (Jumping the chasm is a Challenge 2 task), or it might represent obstacles to complete success (Hacking the system is Challenge 2; Not leaving traces is another Challenge, and not setting off any alarms is another). Challenges can be set by the GM as requirements, or they can be added into a check by the player attempting the check as extra goals.

## Required Challenge (Difficulty)

A Required challenge (or _Difficulty_) is the minimum amount of Effort needed for complete success. By default, all checks have a Required Challenge/Difficulty of 1\. Failing to meet the Required Challenge doesn't always mean failure, particularly if failure would grind the game to a halt. It might mean that the action takes longer than expected, or is successful with a few caveats or twists (like, maybe picking the lock broke the mechanism, or the noise alerted nearby guards). Required Challenges must be met before Added Challenges.

The further you are from the required Challenge, the worse your results. So rolling no successes on a Difficulty 1 check isn't as bad as it would be on a Difficulty 2 check, and so on. The table below provides a guideline for setting Difficulties.

Effort Required |          Difficulty
:-------------: | :---------------------------:
       1        |  Normal, default difficulty
       2        |           Difficult
       3        |             Hard
       4        | Requires high skill or talent
       5        |       Requires mastery
       6        |   Requires mastery and luck

If you're making a check at all, that means that it isn't a given that you're fully succeed. If something is trivial or well within your wheelhouse, you shouldn't be making a check at all. This is a judgment call, but generally for every 5 dice you can pull into a check, you can just not roll for 1 Difficulty - see [Overkill](Overkill.md) for more details.

## Added Challenge

Added challenges are extra things you can accomplish or complications you can avoid by rolling Effort in excess of the Required Challenge. Added Challenges can be thought of as baked-in [Stunts](Stunts.md), except you have to accomplish all Added Challenges before you can spend any Effort on other Stunts. Not achieving an Added Challenge doesn't restore Drama Dice, but it also doesn't stop you from accomplishing your primary goal for the check.

Added Challenges can be added by the player or the GM. In the case of particularly complicated or difficult checks, Added Challenges can be used to outline degrees of success, allowing the character to partially succeed at something that would normally be out of their reach.

## Hidden Challenge

Hidden Challenges are just a way for GMs to note special benefits the player gets for achieving more than the required Effort on a check. If the Effort of the check is higher than the Required Challenge, Hidden Challenges start kicking in, even if the check had Added Challenges. Hidden Challenges also don't stop the player from using extra Effort for Stunts. Failing to achieve Hidden Challenges doesn't restore Drama Dice.

Keep in mind that Hidden Challenges can't stop a character from achieving their goal for the check - they're just extra bonuses beyond their stated goals that the character receives for meeting their goals.
