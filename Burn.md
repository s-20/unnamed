# Burn

Burn represents extra effort - pushing an ability to the point that it is exhausting to achieve a better result. Burning different [Characteristics](Characteristic.md) can provide different benefits, as detailed below. Typically, burning a characteristic allows you to add more of a single type of characteristic to a check - buring a [Trait](Traits.md) allows you to pull an additional Trait into a check, and so on.

## Burn Basics

Burning a [Characteristic](Characteristics.md) can have a few different benefits, but only one benefit at a time. You can only burn an individual Characteristic once in a single check, and you can only burn one characteristic of each type per check. Burning a Characteristic temporarily reduces its rank by 1 after the check, to a minimum of 1\. You cannot burn a Characteristic with a rank of 1 or less.

While some Characteristics have extra options or use special rules, whenever you burn a Characteristic, you gain one of the two following benefits:

- Add the Characteristic to a check even if you've already added a Characteristic of that type. For instance, you can burn a second [Trait](Traits.md) to pull it into a roll that already has a Trait pulled into it. The burned Characteristic must still _make sense_ for the check.
- If you roll enough [Effort](Effort.md) to overcome the difficulty, gain 2 additional Effort for the first burned characteristic, +1 for each additional burned characteristic.

You cannot claim both types of benefit in a single check - the burn either lets you pull additional dice into the check, or it adds extra effort on a successful check.

## Burning Aspects

In addition to the benefits listed above, you can burn an [Aspect](Aspects.md) to avoid injury. If you would recieve a [Wound](WoundThreshold.md), you can burn an Aspect to negate the Wound. That doesn't mean you don't get hurt - it just means you don't get hurt _badly_, and so don't take a Wound.

If you're going to take more than one Wound, then burning an Aspect can reduce the number of Wounds recieved by 1\. The Aspect doesn't need to be related to the wound you're recieving, but avoiding the wound has to be _plausible_ - if you've been dipped in acid, you're going to get hurt, and burning an Aspect won't prevent all the damage.

## Burning Connections

You can only burn [Connections](Connections.md) that represent individual people or organizations. When you do, you're pressuring them to do something they don't want to do or otherwise putting stress on the relationship. Doing so provides one of the benefits listed above normally, and it may also provide something more role play based, i.e. access to an exclusive event, a special weapon on loan, or a meeting with the CEO. There may also be negative roleplay consequences.

Either way, you've put a strain on the relationship, and probably shouldn't push it. You can't usually burn a Connection twice in the same story - request are refused, or you piss them off so badly that they stop talking to you for a while if you try. The rank of a burned Connection may require extra time or some sort of role playing event to restore as well, depending on the nature of the initial burn.

## Recovering from Burn

Burned Characteristics recover whenever it makes sense for them to do so. Generally, you can recover 1 rank to a single Characteristic at the end of each scene, and all burned Characteristics when you get a chance to rest for a while (a night's sleep, a few hours meditation, a week in hospital, etc.). You can also regain burned characteristics as a [Stunt](Stunts.md), and you can recover 2 burned Characteristics after [Combat](Combat.md) as soon as you get a chance to catch your breath - you don't get them back until you can recoup for a few minutes, so if you dive directly into a chase scene of something, you're still winded and don't ahve access to the lost ranks.

Burned Connections are a little different and are handled on a case-by-case basis. A day may be enough for some, while others might take weeks to forgive you. You might be able to accelerate the recovery with a gift, doing them a favor, or otherwise demonstrating that you are about them, value them, are loyal, et cetera.
