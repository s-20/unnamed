# Burn

Burn represents extra effort, or pushing an ability to the point that it is exhausting to achieve a better result. Burning different [Characteristics](Characteristic.md) can provide different benefits, as detailed below. Typically, burning a characteristic allows you to add more of a single type of characteristic to a check: you can Burn a [Trait](Traits.md) to pull it into a check that already has a Trait, and so on.

## Burn Basics

Burning a [Characteristic](Characteristics.md) can have a few different benefits, but only one benefit at a time. You can only burn an individual Characteristic once in a single check. Burning a Characteristic temporarily reduces its rank by 1 after the check, to a minimum of 1. You cannot burn a Characteristic with a rank of 1 or less.

By default, Burning a Characteristic provides one of two benefits, depending on how you use the Burn:

- You can add a Characteristic to a check even if you’ve already added a Characteristic of that type. For instance, you can burn a second [Skill](Skills.md) to pull it into a roll that already has a Skill pulled into the check. The burned Characteristic must still *make sense* for the check.
- If you aren’t adding an extra Characteristic of a single type, you gain 1 free [Effort](Effort.md) for the check by burning the Characteristic.

## Avoiding Wounds

You can Burn a Characteristic to avoid taking a [Wound](WoundThreshold.md). If you‘re hit for a wound, you can reduce the amount of damage you take by 1 if you burn most Characteristics, or by 2 if you burn an [Aspect](Aspects.md). You can reduce the total damage to 0 this way.

In order to burn a Characteristic this way, it has to make some kind of sense. For example, if you were going to get hit with a thrown dagger, you could burn an agility-related characteristic to turn it into a glancing blow, reducing the damage by 1 Wound. If you fall off a building, you could burn your Olympic Gymnast Aspect to avoid turning into a pancake, and so on.

The key is being able to describe your response to the incoming damage in a convincing (or at least plausible) way. If you can’t, then it doesn’t work; you take the wound, and your characteristic remains unburned. This means that sometimes you’re not going to be able to avoid damage this way. If you fall in a pool of lava, you’re going to have trouble coming up with a plausible way to avoid getting badly burned.

During [Combat](Combat.md), burning a characteristic in this way doesn’t count as an action or reaction. You can do it as often as you like in a round, although you can only burn one characteristic per damage source.

## Burning Connections

When you burn [Connections](Connections.md) that represent individual people or organizations, you are pressuring them to do something they don’t want to do or otherwise putting stress on the relationship. Doing so provides one of the benefits listed above normally, and it may also provide something more role-play based, i.e. access to an exclusive event, a special weapon on loan, or a meeting with the CEO. There may also be negative role-play consequences.

Either way, you’ve put a strain on the relationship, and probably shouldn’t push it. Trying to burn a Connection before it’s been restored to full ranks can have serious consequences — you could annoy a friend so much they won’t talk to you for a while, or you could get fired from an organization.

The rank of a burned Connection may require extra time or some sort of role-playing event to restore as well, depending on the nature of the initial burn (if you burned your Friend connection to have them take a bullet for you to avoid damage, you better bring them flowers in the hospital).

## Recovering from Burn

Burned Characteristics recover whenever it makes sense for them to do so. Generally, you can recover 1 rank to a single Characteristic at the end of each scene, and all burned Characteristics when you get a chance to rest for a while (a night’s sleep, a few hours of meditation, a week in hospital, etc.).

You can also regain burned characteristics as a [Stunt](Stunts.md), and you can recover 2 burned Characteristics after [Combat](Combat.md) as soon as you get a chance to catch your breath. You don’t recover them until you can recoup for a few minutes (so if you dive directly into a chase scene of something, you’re still winded and don’t have access to the lost ranks).

Burned Connections are a little different and are handled on a case-by-case basis. A day may be enough for some, while others might take weeks to forgive you. You might be able to accelerate the recovery with a gift, doing them a favor, or otherwise demonstrating that you are about them, value them, are loyal, et cetera.
