# Burn

Burn represents extra effort - pushing an ability to the point that it is exhausting to achieve a better result. Burning usually allows you to roll a d8 instead of a d6, or provides a free success, but at the cost of reducing an ability for a time.

Under normal circumstances, only [Aspects](Aspects.md), [Traits](Traits.md), and [Connections](Connections.md) can be burned.

## Burn Basics

Essentially, when you Burn a characteristic, you temporarily reduce its effectiveness, or lose access to it altogether, in exchange for better possible result. This is usually reflected in using d8s instead of d6s when you pull the characteristic. If the characteristic normally provides d8s, burning it provides a free success instead.

Whenever you Burn something, its stack is temporarily reduced by one. If the stack is reduced to zero, you no can no longer gain dice when pulling that characteristic. This lasts until you get a chance to rest, or until you otherwise have a chance to recover in some way.

## Burning Traits

Traits are the main thing you are likely to Burn on a regular basis. When you Burn a Trait, the dice you receive from pulling it are converted to d8s instead of d6s. Remember that any result of 7 or higher bounces, so this is potentially a very valuable exchange.

After you've Burned the Trait, its stack is reduced by 1. That means that whenever you pull that Trait, you pull one fewer dice. If your stack is reduced to 0, you can no longer pull that Trait for checks.

## Burning Aspects

Aspects can be Burned for a few reasons. Normal burn rules as described above apply, of course; burning an Aspect grants a free success on a check.

In addition, Aspects can be burned for two special effectS: damage reduction and ending some [Conditions](Conditions.md)

### Damage Reduction

Any time you might take damage, you can burn an Aspect to reduce that damage. If you can work the burned Aspect into the a description of how you avoid the damage, it is reduced by 2. If you can't, that's okay, but the damage is only reduced by 1.

### Ending Conditions

[Conditions](Conditions.md) are typically negative ongoing effects on your character; they might include bleeding, being on fire, being poisoned or diseased, et cetera. Most Conditions have a particular duration - five minutes, until you roll 5 successes using Body related traits, an hour, four days, whatever.

You can burn an Aspect to end it. If the Aspect is related to the recovery and you can describe it as such, that might be worth a [Drama Die](DramaDice.md), but this isn't necessary.

## Burning Connections

You can only burn [Connections](Connections.md) that represent individual people or organizations. When you do, you're pressuring them to do something they don't want to do or otherwise putting stress on the relationship.

Doing so provides the usual mechanical benefit (rolling d8 instead of d6), and it often also provides something more role play based, i.e. access to an exclusive event, a special weapon on loan, or a meeting with the CEO. The magnitude of the favor is usually limited by your stack with the Connection.

Either way, you've put a strain on the relationship, and probably shouldn't push it. Calling upon the Connection at all before the Burn is removed permanently reduces its stack by 1. Trying to burn it again permanently reduces its stack to 0 - they're done with you.

Connection stack lost this way cannot be restored without some sort of role play efforts on your part. You must demonstrate loyalty, get your job back, buy them flowers, or whatever it takes to get back in good graces. Depending on the situation, this may be impossible.

[Advancements](Advancement.md) and [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md) cannot be used to recover lost Connections.

### Recovering from Burn

You recover one burned Trait or Aspect every time you pause for a few minutes rest. An couple hours of down time usually restores all burned Aspects and Traits. This down time can be spent doing anything that relaxes or energizes the character - sleep, video games, carousing, whatever.

Burned Connections are a little different and are handled on a case-by-case basis. A day may be enough for some, while others might take weeks to forgive you. You might be able to accelerate the recovery with a gift, doing them a favor, or otherwise demonstrating that you are about them, value them, are loyal, et cetera.
