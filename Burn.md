# Burn

Burn represents extra effort - pushing an ability to the point that it is exhausting to achieve a better result. Burning usually doubles the number of successes gained from the dice rolled for the burned Characteristic at the cost of reducing that characteristic for a time. 

Only [Aspects](Aspects.md), [Traits](Traits.md), and some [Connections](Connections.md) can be burned. Other characteristics cannot be used in this way, but may have their own success-doubling mechanics.

## Burn Basics

Essentially, when you Burn a characteristic, you temporarily reduce its effectiveness, or lose access to it altogether, in exchange for better possible result. This is usually reflected by doubling the successes gained from the dice that were burned.

Whenever you Burn something, its stack is temporarily reduced by one. If the stack is reduced to zero, you no can no longer gain dice when pulling that characteristic. This lasts until you get a chance to rest, or until you otherwise have a chance to recover in some way.

## Special Uses of Burn

You can sometimes BUrn a characteristic for something other than a Check. Those special uses of burn are outlined below.

- **Damage Reduction** - Whenever a character would receive a [Wound](WoundThreshold.md), you may burn an [Aspect](Aspects.md) to reduce the number of wounds received by 1. You may burn up to two Aspects in this way at a time.
- **Suspend a Condition** - You can burn a [Trait](Traits.md) to suspend a [Condition](Conditions.md), ignoring it for a short time. This usually lasts long enough for the character to accomplish a single action or a short goal. Not all Conditions can be ignored in this way.
- **Recover from a Condition** - You can burn an [Apsect](Aspects.md) to completely recover from some [Conditions](Conditions.md). Not all Conditions can be removed in this way.

## Burning Connections

You can only burn [Connections](Connections.md) that represent individual people or organizations. When you do, you're pressuring them to do something they don't want to do or otherwise putting stress on the relationship.

Doing so provides the usual mechanical benefit (doubled successes), and it often also provides something more role play based, i.e. access to an exclusive event, a special weapon on loan, or a meeting with the CEO. The magnitude of the favor is usually limited by your stack with the Connection.

Either way, you've put a strain on the relationship, and probably shouldn't push it. Calling upon the Connection at all before the Burn is removed permanently reduces its stack by 1. Trying to burn it again permanently reduces its stack to 0 - they're done with you.

Connection stack lost this way cannot be restored without some sort of role play efforts on your part. You must demonstrate loyalty, get your job back, buy them flowers, or whatever it takes to get back in good graces. Depending on the situation, this may be impossible.

[Advancements](Advancement.md) and [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md) cannot be used to recover lost Connections, although they can be regained through Awards and role play.

## Recovering from Burn

You recover one burned Trait or Aspect every time you pause for a few minutes rest, at the GM's discretion; An couple hours of down time may restore more. This down time can be spent doing anything that relaxes or energizes the character - sleep, video games, carousing, whatever.

Sometimes, a specific activity may be required to restore a burn. FOr example, if you burn an endurance related trait, you might need a good night's sleep to recover it. If you burn a social trait, you might need some alone time, or the opposite - you might need a good party to recover!

Burned Connections are a little different and are handled on a case-by-case basis. A day may be enough for some, while others might take weeks to forgive you. You might be able to accelerate the recovery with a gift, doing them a favor, or otherwise demonstrating that you are about them, value them, are loyal, et cetera.
