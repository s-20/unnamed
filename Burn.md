# Burn

Burn represents extra effort - pushing an ability to the point that it is exhausting to achieve a better result. Burning different [Characteristics](Characteristic.md) can provide different benefits, as detailed in the individual characteristic pages and below. Basically, though, burning a characteristic allows you to add more of a single type of characteristic to a check - buring a [Trait](Traits.md) allows you to pull an additional Trait into a check, and so on. How this affects the roll varies.

## Burn Basics

When you Burn a characteristic, you temporarily reduce its effectiveness, or lose access to it altogether. In exchange, you either gain more dice for the check or improve your chances of success in some other way.

Whenever you Burn something, its stack is temporarily reduced by one. If the stack is reduced to zero, you no can no longer gain dice when pulling that characteristic. This lasts until you get a chance to rest, or until you otherwise have a chance to recover in some way. The more burned characteristics you have, the longer it will take for you to recover, but any significant amount of downtime is often enough to recover everything.

When you burn a Characteristic, any benefit you gain is based on the ranks you had *before* you burned it. For example, if you have the Trait Strength 4 and you choose to burn it for a check, you gain 4 additional dice for that check, and *then* your Strength is reduced by 1.

### Burning Aspects

[Aspects](Aspects.md) aren't usually burned; instead, any Aspect that applies to a given check provides [Synergy](Synergy.md). However, you *can* burn an Aspect to avoid a [Wound](WoundThreshold.md). The Aspect has to apply to the situation in some way.

### Burning Connections

You can only burn [Connections](Connections.md) that represent individual people or organizations. When you do, you're pressuring them to do something they don't want to do or otherwise putting stress on the relationship.

Doing so provides the usual mechanical benefit (doubled successes), and it often also provides something more role play based, i.e. access to an exclusive event, a special weapon on loan, or a meeting with the CEO. The magnitude of the favor is usually limited by your stack with the Connection.

Either way, you've put a strain on the relationship, and probably shouldn't push it. Calling upon the Connection at all before the Burn is removed permanently reduces its stack by 1. Trying to burn it again permanently reduces its stack to 0 - they're done with you.

Connection stack lost this way cannot be restored without some sort of role play efforts on your part. You must demonstrate loyalty, get your job back, buy them flowers, or whatever it takes to get back in good graces. Depending on the situation, this may be impossible.

## Recovering from Burn

You recover one burned Trait or Aspect every time you pause for a few minutes rest, at the GM's discretion; An couple hours of down time may restore more. This down time can be spent doing anything that relaxes or energizes the character - sleep, video games, carousing, whatever.

Sometimes, a specific activity may be required to restore a burn. FOr example, if you burn an endurance related trait, you might need a good night's sleep to recover it. If you burn a social trait, you might need some alone time, or the opposite - you might need a good party to recover!

Burned Connections are a little different and are handled on a case-by-case basis. A day may be enough for some, while others might take weeks to forgive you. You might be able to accelerate the recovery with a gift, doing them a favor, or otherwise demonstrating that you are about them, value them, are loyal, et cetera.
