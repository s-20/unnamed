# Side Stuff Index

This is all the stuff I felt was fit to share, but doesn't have anything to do with the unnamed System. All of the ```.md``` files will be formatted  ```SS*.md```, as in ```SSIndex.md```, et al.

## Alt Systems

The game systems/mechanics/etc/ that I come up with in the shower, or while playing Dead Cells.

## Settings and Campaigns

Game setting/setup ideas and other fluffy nonesense.

## Homebrew for other systems

Basically, homebrewed content for published systems. Wherever licensing is in conflict, the original system's license takes precedent when it's an "open" license (for instance, Pathfinder stuff is SRD rather than CC). If it's a "closed" license, then it's back to CC-by-A.

### Pathfinder 1e (SRD)

Been a fan since the original Beta. I've already made *a lot* of content. It might as well go somewhere.

### Pathfinder 2e (SRD)

This game kinda hurts my soul, because it's very close to what I want out of a game, but I'm not sure I'll ever get to play it.

### Storypath System (CC-by-A)

I've recently gotten into Scion 2e, and so I might write up pantheons or something.

### Mutants and Masterminds 2e (SRD)

I may wind up just posting characters here.

### Powered by the Apocalypse

I dunno if anything will ever be here, but as narrative-focused systems go, PbtA is pretty neat and easy to work with, so I'm reserving space.
