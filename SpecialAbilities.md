# Special Abilities

Special abilities are ways in which the characters can mess with how the world around them works in interesting and creative ways. They represent things like magic, psychic ability, super powers, and superhuman martial prowess.

Not all campaigns will use Special Abilities.

## Entry Requirements

Depending on your Campaign, you may need to do certain things to gain access to Special Ablities. These things vary from campaign to campaign and ability to ability, and may include any of the following:

- *Origin Requirement* - You may have to specify the source of the powers in your [Origin](Origin.md); this is almost always a requirement.
- *Aspect Requirement* - You may have to dedicate an [Aspect](Aspects.md) to the Special Ability (resulting in Aspects like Psychic Ability, Cybernetically Enhanced, or Faerie Blooded).
- *Trait Requirement* - You may need to take one or more stack in a particular [Trait](Traits.md) or [Metatrait](MetaTraits.md).
- *Connection Requirement* - Some Special Abilities require justification through [Connections](Connections.md); this might mean a Temporal Connection (Present at the Blue Event), a Personal Connection (Sensei Shi, Master of the Flying Fist), or anything else that makes sense in context. This will usually require a stack above 1.
- *Complication Requirement* - The Special Ability might require you to take one or more Complications. For example, in the Marvel 616, Stigma: Mutant would be required if you got your powers from being a Mutant.
- *Adjustment Point Requirement* - Finally, you might have to dedicate some or all of your [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md) to gaining access to Special Abilities. It's usually best to use one of the preceeding methods instead of this one, but this might be aprropriate for buying individual Spells (Exploits, see below) or similar small additions.

## The Basics

Special Abilities start with a overall description - three or fewer sentences that outline what the abilities are intended to accomplish.

Each Special Ability is made up of at least two major components, and may have more. The components of the Special Ability are:

1. **Sketch** - A brief outline of what the power is, where it comes from, and a summary of what you want it to do. This is comparable to a character's [Origin](Origin.md), but narrowed down to a special ability.
2. **Features** - parts of the special ability that directly affect gameplay, but don't themselves require rolls (although they may modify the results of other rolls).
3. **Exploits** - Discrete effects or groups of effects that draw from an [Energy Pool](Energy.md) of some kind. Exploits are limited use things, kind of like Spells and similar effects, that can be done quickly and may be useful in combat. Exploits may or may not require a check, depending on their individual setup.
4. **Powers** - Powers are aspects of Special Abilities similar to Features, except they can be pulled directly into checks, or require checks to use. Powers can be [Burned](Burn.md) for extra effort just like [Traits](Traits.md).
5. **Procedures** - Similar to Exploits, Porcedures are discrete effects or groups of effects that can be quite powerful, but require significantly more time than an Exploit, and do not normally require the use of [Energy](Energy.md). They may incur a *Loss*, however (see below).
6. **Side Effects** - These are quirks, small or large, that accompany the use of the Special Ability. They can be funny, inconvenient, annoying, or downright dangerous.
7. **Losses** - Some Special Abilities have costs other than [Energy](Energy.md) or just time. They may drain [Traits](Traits.md) or other characteristics, or inflict [Conditions](Conditions.md), or even inflict [Wounds](WoundThreshold.md).
8. **Flaws** - Specific weaknesses or inabilities of a Special Ability, like being ineffective against the color yellow, getting shut down in the presence of a specific type of glowing green rock, or not working when your hands have been bound by a man.
