# Special Abilities

Special abilities (abbreviated SA) are ways in which the characters can mess with how the world around them works in interesting and creative ways. They represent things like magic, psychic ability, super powers, and superhuman martial prowess.

Not all campaigns will use this Special Abilities subsystem, even campaigns that have them. For example, in a campaign where everyone has the same abilities, or abilities are small tweaks (like the Features described below), or when you just don't want the added complexity, you can bypass this system.

All SAs are tailored to the individual character. SAs *must* be created in cooperation between the GM and the player, and *should* be made in cooperation with the whole group. Group chat rooms like Discord or online forums can be very useful for this, allowing everyone to discuss things at a as-you-can-get-to-it pace to keep your [Session 0](Parameters.md) from getting completely bogged down in SA discussions.

## Entry Requirements

Depending on your Campaign, you may need to do certain things to gain access to Special Ablities. These things vary from campaign to campaign and ability to ability, and may include any of the following:

- *Origin Requirement* - You may have to specify the source of the powers in your [Origin](Origin.md); this is almost always a requirement.
- *Aspect Requirement* - You may have to dedicate an [Aspect](Aspects.md) to the Special Ability (resulting in Aspects like Psychic Ability, Cybernetically Enhanced, or Faerie Blooded).
- *Trait Requirement* - You may need to take one or more stack in a particular [Trait](Traits.md) or [Metatrait](MetaTraits.md).
- *Connection Requirement* - Some Special Abilities require justification through [Connections](Connections.md); this might mean a Temporal Connection (Present at the Blue Event), a Personal Connection (Sensei Shi, Master of the Flying Fist), or anything else that makes sense in context. This will usually require a stack above 1.
- *Complication Requirement* - The Special Ability might require you to take one or more Complications. For example, in the Marvel 616, Stigma: Mutant would be required if you got your powers from being a Mutant.
- *Adjustment Point Requirement* - Finally, you might have to dedicate some or all of your [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md) to gaining access to Special Abilities. It's usually best to use one of the preceeding methods instead of this one, but this might be aprropriate for buying individual Spells (Exploits, see below) or similar small additions.

## How Many do I Get?

This is a question that's difficult to answer, and requires judgement on the part of both the player and the GM. Generally speaking, because of how broad the subsystem is, one is sufficient for most starting characters.

The unnamed System doesn't handle powers and similar Special Abilities the way other games do. Because things like how much damage you can do in combat and other balancing factors are [handled](Combat.md) [elsewhere](WoundThreshold.md), the Special Ability section can focus on doing cool, fun things. Because of this shift in focus, abilities can be very broad and cover a lot of ground. For example, basically all of Spider Man's abilities other than his web shooters are all one Special Ability.

That same freedom comes at a cost, however. The bespoke nature of the SA subsystem means that each character's SA takes time to create, and considerations and concessions must be made on all sides of the discussion to avoid something that will throw off the story or make play difficult or challenges trivial.

So, the answer here is **be reasonable**. You have as many SAs as it takes to make your character, but one ability can go a long way. Basically, anything that can be included in a single Sketch (see below) is a single ability, even if it has many, many applications.

## The Basics

Special Abilities start with a overall description - three or fewer sentences that outline what the abilities are intended to accomplish.

Each Special Ability is made up of at least two major components, and may have more. The components of the Special Ability are:

1. **Sketch** - A brief outline of what the power is, where it comes from, and a summary of what you want it to do. This is comparable to a character's [Origin](Origin.md), but narrowed down to a special ability. All SAs require a Sketch.
2. **Features** - parts of the special ability that directly affect gameplay, but don't themselves require rolls (although they may modify the results of other rolls).
3. **Exploits** - Discrete effects or groups of effects that draw from an [Energy Pool](Energy.md) of some kind. Exploits are limited use things, kind of like Spells and similar effects, that can be done quickly and may be useful in combat. Exploits may or may not require a check, depending on their individual setup.
4. **Powers** - Powers are aspects of Special Abilities similar to Features, except they can be pulled directly into checks, or require checks to use. Powers can be [Burned](Burn.md) for extra effort just like [Traits](Traits.md).
5. **Procedures** - Similar to Exploits, Porcedures are discrete effects or groups of effects that can be quite powerful, but require significantly more time than an Exploit, and do not normally require the use of [Energy](Energy.md). They may incur a *Loss*, however (see below).
6. **Side Effects** - These are quirks, small or large, that accompany the use of the Special Ability. They can be funny, inconvenient, annoying, or downright dangerous.
7. **Losses** - Some Special Abilities have costs other than [Energy](Energy.md) or just time. They may drain [Traits](Traits.md) or other characteristics, or inflict [Conditions](Conditions.md), or even inflict [Wounds](WoundThreshold.md).
8. **Flaws** - Specific weaknesses or inabilities of a Special Ability, like being ineffective against the color yellow, getting shut down in the presence of a specific type of glowing green rock, or not working when your hands have been bound by a man.

## Specifics

In the tabs below, you'll find specific rules for each of the different components described above. Each tab will also provide examples.

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Sketch**

A Sketch outlines the basics of your SA and what you hope to accomplish with it. It starts with a few sentences that describe where the power comes from, it's theme, and its scope:

?> *Miles has spider-themed abilities that are the result of being bitten by a genetically engineer spider causing him to become a Spider Totem. He has the proportionate strength, agility, speed, and endurance of a spider, an innate danger sense, can zap people with "venom blasts", and has a chameleon ability, although what that has to do with spiders I don't know.

A sketch is completed by providing a short outline of the other components in the SA. This part should be completed after you've pulled in all the stuff you want to use for the Special Ability, and is used as a quick reference.

Each Sketch contains *one* source of power, however. to continue the Spider Man example, Miles needs a separate SA for his web shooters, because they're a product of technology, not his actual spider powers.

### **Features**

Features are parts of a Special Ability that just work. While features might affect what you can do with certain skills or other characteristics, they don't specifically require any checks to use.

?> *Examples: Super Strength, Wall Crawling, Super Agility**

Features should be described in a single sentence. For example, say that you're making a psychic, and you want them to be able to see auras, allowing them to spot people who are in distress, better spot lies, and so on. You could describe the Feature like this:

?> **Aura Sight**: Claire can see auras, allowing her to spot the supernatural and read moods, giving her bonus successes to detecting lies and similar lsituations.

### **Exploits**

### **Powers**

### **Procedures**

### **Side Effects**

### **Losses**

### **Flaws**

## Ability Stunts

## SA Packaging

If a group wants to add consistency to a game setting and make Special Ability creation a bit faster, they can create SA Packages. An SA Package is a predefined partial sketch and set of components. Basically, you create a brief outline to establish a baseline for an ability type. Then, when someone wants to make a character of that type, much of the work has been done for them.

SA Packages should still be customized per character, making that particular version unique to the character, unless everyone with those abilities is identical in the setting. For example, an SA Package for Wizards in a Fantasy Setting might outline all the basic components of wizardry, but not the specific spells each wizard would have.

SA Packages can also be used to pregenerate certain specific character alterations (like cyberware or magic items) that can be picked up along the way. Yes - in the unnamed System, magic items are considered Special Abilities.
