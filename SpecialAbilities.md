# Special Abilities

Different Special Abilities work in different ways. Typically, you will have to do one or more of the following, however:

1. Make a specific Skill check
2. Burn a Trait or Aspect
3. Take a [Wound](WoundThreshold.md)
4. Take a [Condition](COnditions.md) (usually Fatigued)
5. Spend a [Perk](MarksPerks.md) or gain a [Mark](MarksPerks.md)
6. Spend [Energy Traits](EnergyTraits.md)

Some Special Abilities don't require any of the above, however; they just automatically kick in in certain circumstances.
