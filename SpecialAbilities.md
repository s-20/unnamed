# Special Abilities

Special abilities are ways in which the characters can mess with how the world around them works in interesting and creative ways. They represent things like magic, psychic ability, super powers, and superhuman martial prowess.

Not all campaigns will use Special Abilities. Those that do will probably not use all the things described in this section. It's possible to combine them all, but it makes for a lot of choices and headaches for groups in keeping track of rules.

The Special Abilities system has a lot of moving parts so that you can make things feel mechanically different, which leads to a different feel in play, along with different things a character must do to perform their special attacks, defenses, or utilities.

## The Basics

Special Abilities start with a overall description - three or fewer sentences that outline what the abilities are intended to accomlish.

### Entry Requirements

## Using the Abilities

Stick with the level of crunch your group is comfortable with - or, at the least, that the GM and the player using the system are comfortable with. All of these are designed to feel different, but they all do similar things and can be adapted to a variety of purposes.
