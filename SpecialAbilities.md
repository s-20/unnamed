# Special Abilities

Special Abilities is a cath-call category for things like super powers, magic, hyper-skills, cybernetics, and so on. In short, Special Abilities cover all the abilities that are beyond the norm for a given campaign.

This nebulous definition is intentional; what qualifies as "special" can very from game to game. In a campaign set in the Cloud City of the Winged Elves, the power of flight isn't a special ability, it's a given, and not having it is a [Tangle](Tangles.md).

## Basics

Special Abilities are defined individually for each character, and are set up in broad terms, using a few sentences to outline them. Some Special Abilities rely just on this description and the application of [Energy](Energy.md), while others rely on a Framework.

Using a Special Ability either relies on using it descriptively in a scene, or pulling dice for a check based on appropriate [Characteristics](Characteristics.md). This makes them operate like other Characteristics - if there are stakes and a chance of failure, or if degrees of success couldhave interesting story impact, you pull dice for a check. Otherwise, you describe what happens and move on.

### Pulling Dice

What Characteristics are needed for a given check depend on the Special Ability and the Situation, just like any other check. Sometimes, a Special Ability can be as simple as a sort-of *super-[Synergy](Synergy.md)*, adding free [Effort](Effort.md) if any effort at all is rolled, or doubling rolled effort, or some similar success-increasing effect. 

Other Special Abilities just let you do things a normal human being couldn't (Magic lets you cast spells, for instance).
