# Special Abilities (WIP)

Special abilities are things like magic, super powers, cybernetics, combat techniques, and other things that give you an edge over normal humans. In short, they're stuff normal people can't do.

In a game that has Special Abilities, all players get the same access to them based on the [Scale](#-scale) of the campaign.

Special Abilities are optional, and while building them is intentionally disconnected from the rest of your character, there are often mechanical links between them. In other words, while your [Characteristics](Characteristics.md) and [Statistics](Statistics.md) can apply to your Special Abilities, you don't have to sacrifice anything from those parts of your character to have fun and effective Special Abilities. 

## Basics

In unnamed, it's more important to have the abilities you want, and that fit your character, than it is for everyone to be *balanced*. 

> This is the *Superman/Batman Principle*: both of them are members of the Justice League and work together on the same missions, but they have wildly different power levels. Realistically, in a battle to the death, Batman doesn't stand a chance against someone who can literally punch a planet in half and move faster than the eye can see. Sure, Batman's the peak of human perfection and a tactical genius, but that'll only get you so far against someone who can perform precise brain surgery with heat vision through the lens of your eye. In the comics, though, they're presented as equals.

The way it works is simple enough in principle, and at its most basic is similar to how [Aspects](Aspects.md) work: define the power in a few sentences, and then either pull it into rolls or use it to describe actions those without the power couldn't do. 

As an ongoing campaign progresses, the power description can be expanded and new ways of using the power can be discovered. These expansions aren't *bought* using [Advancements](Advancement.md), but are instead added organically as they come up in play.

There are two components to Special Abilities that need to be decided at a per-campaign level and outlined in the [Parameters](Parameters.md): *[Scale](#scale)* (the general power level of the game), and *[Ability Origins](#origin)* (where the abilities can come from). Once these have been established, you can move on to *[Description](#description)*, *[Applications](#application)* and *[Energy](#energy)* which define the special abilities in game terms. Finally, to keep some internal consistency in a given game, you can use *[Frameworks](#frameworks)* to outline how specific types of Special Ability work.

## Scale

Scale is a story-wide measure of the power (or potential power) of the character's Special Abilities. The higher the scale, the more powerful, broad, and/or earth-shattering the abilities are. Scale is a value from 1 to 10; see the [table below](#scale-chart). When using your Special Abilities, you can pull Scale as though it were a Characteristic to add dice to a check, but it can't be [Burned](Burn.md) because it's a property of the setting, not your character.

Scale can actually vary within a given setting depending on the individual story or campaign; a game involving Superman and Batman has a different scale than one centering around Lois Lane and Jimmy Olson, but they occupy the same universe. The scale chosen for an individual game usually applies to the PCs, not the universe it is set in.

As previously stated, once the Scale is established, all characters have access to powers or abilities of that scale. That doesn't mean they *have* to have powers of that scale, of course. If you prefer a lower Scale for your character, you can define your powers that way if you like. When you pull Scale when using these lower level abilities, you still get the same number of dice by default, however.

### Scale Chart

| Scale | Name | Description |
| --- | --- |--- |
| 1 | Perks | The characters have abilities that can be mistaken for natural phenomena, high skill, or simple luck. The characters *themselves* may be unaware that they have special powers. At this Scale, characters don't usually have access to [Energy](#energy). |
| 2-3 | Minor | Characters have more obvious and powerful abilities that set them apart from, but not out of the reach of, normals. Special Abilities at this scale might still be able to pass for simple talent, but tend to stand out more. |
| 4-5 | Major | The characters have abilities that truly set them apart from others, and are impossible to mistake for natural abilities. |
| 6-7 | Planetary | The characters have powerful and/or broadly applicable special abilities that can alter the course of history. The characters definitely qualify as *super-heroes* at this scale. |
| 8-9 | Cosmic | The characters can do things like alter planetary orbits, create pocket dimensions, or understand and manipulate the fundamental forces of the universe. The characters are easily mistaken for deities. |
| 10 | Godlike | At this scale, the characters effectively *are* deities. Their powers can affect the *multiverse*, they can punch stars, survive black holes, and perhaps affect entire galaxies. |

## Origin

The Origin describes where the Special Ability comes from. This could include just about anything allowable by the Parameters. Martial Arts and Ki, magical energy and training, psychic talent, ultra-tech weapons and armor, superhuman mutation, radioactive spider bite â€” you name it.

An individual campaign may have predefined Origins, the player might make up their own, or both. Most of the time, a character should only have one Special Ability Origin regardless of how many Special Abilities they have. While there are a few exceptions (Spider-man has both his radioactive spider bite and his super-tech web shooters, for instance), most characters derive all their powers from a single source. Even in Spider-man's case, all the abilities are at least *in theme*.

By default, Origin is more of a thematic and story choice, rather than a mechanical one. It operates like a [Detail](Details.md) mechanically, granting [Synergy](Synergy.md) when it comes up.

It can also be used in other ways, depending on the setting. For instance, maybe anyone in a given setting with magical special abilities has a chance to sense the presence of active magic. It can also be used (depending on campaign Parameters) to control access to [Energy](#energy), or provide other benefits, weaknesses, or abilities.
