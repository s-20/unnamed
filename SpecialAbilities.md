# Special Abilities (WIP)

Special abilities are things like magic, super powers, cybernetics, combat techniques, and other things that give you an edge over normal humans. In short, they're stuff normal people can't do.

In a game that has Special Abilities, all players get the same access to them based on the [Scale](#-scale) of the campaign.

Special Abilities are optional, and while building them is intentionally disconnected from the rest of your character, there are often mechanical links between them. In other words, while your [Characteristics](Characteristics.md) and [Statistics](Statistics.md) can apply to your Special Abilities, you don't have to sacrifice anything from those parts of your character to have fun and effective Special Abilities. 

## Basics

In unnamed, it's more important to have the abilities you want, and that fit your character, than it is for everyone to be *balanced*. 

> This is the *Superman/Batman Principle*: both of them are members of the Justice League and work together on the same missions, but they have wildly different power levels. Realistically, in a battle to the death, Batman doesn't stand a chance against someone who can literally punch a planet in half and move faster than the eye can see. Sure, Batman's the peak of human perfection and a tactical genius, but that'll only get you so far against someone who can perform precise brain surgery with heat vision through the lens of your eye. In the comics, though, they're presented as equals.

The way it works is simple enough in principle, and at its most basic is similar to how [Aspects](Aspects.md) work: define the power in a few sentences, and then either pull it into rolls or use it to describe actions those without the power couldn't do. 

As an ongoing campaign progresses, the power description can be expanded and new ways of using the power can be discovered. These expansions aren't *bought* using [Advancements](Advancement.md), but are instead added organically as they come up in play.

There are two components to Special Abilities that need to be decided at a per-campaign level and outlined in the [Parameters](Parameters.md): *[Scale](#scale)* (the general power level of the game), and *[Ability Origins](#origin)* (where the abilities can come from). Once these have been established, you can move on to *[Description](#description)*, *[Applications](#application)* and *[Energy](#energy)* which define the special abilities in game terms. Finally, to keep some internal consistency in a given game, you can use *[Frameworks](#frameworks)* to outline how specific types of Special Ability work.

## Scale

Scale is a story-wide measure of the power (or potential power) of the character's Special Abilities. The higher the scale, the more powerful, broad, and/or earth-shattering the abilities are. Scale is a value from 1 to 10; see the [table below](#scale-chart).

Scale can actually vary within a given setting depending on the individual story or campaign; a game involving Superman and Batman has a different scale than one centering around Lois Lane and Jimmy Olson, but they occupy the same universe. The scale chosen for an individual game usually applies to the PCs, not the universe it is set in.

If a character has multiple Special Abilities, only one will be at full Scale. Additional Special Abilities are usually at half scale or lower. If characters are allowed multiple Special Abilities then all characters *can* have the same number, but don't need to. Characters should be limited to no more than three Special Abilities under most circumstances, unless you're shooting for greater granularity.

As previously stated, once the Scale is established, all characters have access to powers or abilities of that scale. That doesn't mean they *have* to have powers of that scale, of course. If you prefer a lower Scale for your character, you can define your powers that way if you like. When you pull Scale when using these lower level abilities, you still get the same number of dice by default, however.

### Scale Chart

| Scale | Name | Description |
| --- | --- |--- |
| 1 | Perks | The characters have abilities that can be mistaken for natural phenomena, high skill, or simple luck. The characters *themselves* may be unaware that they have special powers. At this Scale, characters don't usually have access to [Energy](#energy). |
| 2-3 | Minor | Characters have more obvious and powerful abilities that set them apart from, but not out of the reach of, normals. Special Abilities at this scale might still be able to pass for simple talent, but tend to stand out more. |
| 4-5 | Major | The characters have abilities that truly set them apart from others, and are impossible to mistake for natural abilities. |
| 6-7 | Planetary | The characters have powerful and/or broadly applicable special abilities that can alter the course of history. The characters definitely qualify as *super-heroes* at this scale. |
| 8-9 | Cosmic | The characters can do things like alter planetary orbits, create pocket dimensions, or understand and manipulate the fundamental forces of the universe. The characters are easily mistaken for deities. |
| 10 | Godlike | At this scale, the characters effectively *are* deities. Their powers can affect the *multiverse*, they can punch stars, survive black holes, and perhaps affect entire galaxies. |

It's important to note that the Scale chart is *flexible*. There are things listed here that might be on a lower or higher level based on your setting. For example, perhaps you don't think that creating pocket dimensions would be out of place for spell-casters in your otherwise Scale 5 sword-and-sorcery campaign. Any adjustments like this should be discussed among the players and the GM, to make sure everyone is operating from the same set of rules. 

On a similar note, making one thing from a higher scale available as a plot point or a focus of a campaign or story arc doesn't change the Scale of the campaign as a whole; it may just be a MacGuffin. 

## Origin

The Origin describes where the Special Ability comes from. This could include just about anything allowable by the Parameters. Martial Arts and Ki, magical energy and training, psychic talent, ultra-tech weapons and armor, superhuman mutation, radioactive spider bite â€” you name it.

An individual campaign may have predefined Origins, the player might make up their own, or both. Most of the time, a character should only have one Special Ability Origin regardless of how many Special Abilities they have. While there are a few exceptions (Spider-man has both his radioactive spider bite and his super-tech web shooters, for instance), most characters derive all their powers from a single source. Even in Spider-man's case, all the abilities are at least *in theme*.

By default, Origin is more of a thematic and story choice, rather than a mechanical one. It operates like a [Detail](Details.md) mechanically, granting [Synergy](Synergy.md) when it comes up.

It can also be used in other ways, depending on the setting. For instance, maybe anyone in a given setting with magical special abilities has a chance to sense the presence of active magic. It can also be used (depending on campaign Parameters) to control access to [Energy](#energy), or provide other benefits, weaknesses, or abilities. 

## Description

The Special Ability description provides the information you need to use the ability in the context of the story. The Description is one or more sentences that outline what the special ability is. Think of it as the blurb at the beginning of a superhero comic that describes what the main characters can do.

Here are a few examples that might seem familiar:

* *Peter has the powers of a spider: enhanced strength and reflexes, the ability to cling to surfaces and walk on walls, and a powerful danger sense*
* *Steven is the Sorcerer Supreme of Earth, with access to spells and the ability to manipulate magical energies on a cosmic scale*
* *As an Amazon demigod, Diana has phenomenal strength and lightning reflexes, can fly, and can resist most mundane sources of damage*

And a few less specific examples:

* *Jane has superhuman archery skills allowing her to perform amazing trick shots. She also possesses agility beyond that of an Olympic gymnast*
* *Bobby's cybernetic implants allow them to communicate directly with any computer that has any sort of wireless interface*
* *Thanks to his bloodline, John can summon elemental spirits to aid him both in and out of battle*

When possible, a single description should cover all the abilities granted by a single Origin. The description can be as many sentences as you need to explain the ability, but shouldn't be *too* specific, and allow some wiggle room to expand, push, or reach as needed. *Strong enough to lift a truck* is better than *Can lift ten tons*, for example.

A Description doesn't always contain everything the Special Ability can do. Instead, it represents your current understanding of the scope of your abilities. Events in the game can expand these abilities, and different situations might bring special uses. In addition, [Energy](#energy) can be used to expand a Special Ability.

### Application

To use an ability in game, you pull together a check based on your [Characteristics](Characteristics.md) as usual. Your Special Ability by itself doesn't really add additional mechanics, it just lets you use the existing rules in different ways. A character with *superhuman strength* can do things with their Characteristics that someone without that Special Ability can't even imagine doing.

If two individuals are clashing who have different [Scales](#scale), the one with the higher Scale gets bonus [Effort](Effort.md) on their check equal to the difference. So if someone using a Scale 3 ability goes up against someone with a Scale 5 ability, the individual at Scale 5 would get +2 Effort for their check before they even rolled.

## Frameworks

Frameworks allow you to set up general special abilities that follow a theme, giving you a shorthand that provides consistence within a given campaign. Once Frameworks are established in a campaign, they all use the same description as a baseline, and any variance or additional abilities are included in the Special Ability description.

For example, perhaps you have an organization of superhuman thieves in your setting who all have a few abilities in common. You could use that to set up the following Framework:

> **Rogues of Assalon**<br>
> The Rogues of Assalon can shroud their presence: their footsteps make no noise, they leave behind no tracks, and even when spotted, they tend to be dismissed as shadows. In addition, they can scale sheer walls without equipment, and simple locks come open at their touch

After the framework was established, it could be added to any character in the campaign just by writing **Rogue of Assalon**, and could be expanded by saying something like *Jin is a Rogue of Assalon who has expanded their shroud to include leaving behind no trace of their presence at all; anything they moved shifts back to where it was after they leave the scene*.

Frameworks can be used to establish any consistent ability you'd like in your setting. For example, if all Elves in your fantasy game are agile and can see in the dark, you could use that description as your framework. Any elf character could then gain free Effort from Scale in matters of opposed agility and use their observational characteristics to see things in dark places.

## Energy

[Energy](Energy.md) is a special group of [Statistics](Statistics.md) that allow you to perform powerful feats, usually based on your Special Abilities. Energy is either a spendable or buildable resource. That is, it either represents a pool you can draw from until it is depleted, or it is a growing power source that opens extra stuff up over time. 

When setting up your Special Abilities, you should note any Energy you have access to and what it is used for; see the full [Energy](Energy.md) article for more details.
