# Gods of Chaos Character Profile

Gods of Chaos is the upcoming play-test for my as-yet unnamed game system. Set in the New Defenders multiverse in a timeline adjacent to the original campaign, the campaign centers around a Game that turns out to be much more serious than you initially thought it would be, and will result in (surviving) characters having full-fledged superpowers. Character death is on the table, although probably not for the first few sessions. There will be investigation, combat, some light horror elements (mildly creepy, not outright scary/horrifying), and other fun stuff.

This is a summary and limited parsing of the conversation(s) we've had about your character so far.

In addition, I have a [Character Background Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s-20/unnamed/master/PlaytestNotes/CharacterBakcgroundTemplate.md) you can use to fill in some details related to Appearance and History. *Anything* that's on a character sheet for this system can potentially provide a bonus ([Synergy](https:////s-20.github.io/unnamed/#.Synergy)) depending on circumstances, so having more details is better, but it's all up to you.

And, finally, I have a [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/gods-of-chaos-28defenders-multiverse-alpha7CC6A131429-s20) page for the game, although it's very much a work in progress.

## Summary

[CHARNAME] is an 18 year old veterinary student attending University of Wisconsin at Lake City. They just moved in within the last week or so, staying at Bjornsen Hall on the University campus, and have already secured a work-study at the nearby Lake City Zoo. Back in Minnesota, they have a Mom (37, Real Estate) and a kid sister.

[CHARNAME] enjoys some limited notoriety as part of a major guild in the anime themed MMORPG tank battle game *Iron Waltz Online*, although their only substantial online presence is on FriendFind.

## Remaining Questions

Names for your family, and yourself (along with stuff like physical description). Also, the name of your Hometown, although I'll fill that in for you if you'd prefer.

Interests outside of Gaming and School (hobbies, political groups, interest level in superhero/metahuman news, any elective classes, sports, club memberships, etc.)

You have some degree of familiarity with self-defense. What is it? How much time (if any) do you put into training?

Tell me more about your little sister.

## Character Data

### [Characteristics](https://s-20.github.io/unnamed/#/Characteristics)

This is what I've gleaned from our conversation so far, but your perspective is more important. So, these are just suggestions. I've included links to the articles in the Wiki for each type of Characteristic.

- [Aspects](https://s-20.github.io/unnamed/#/Aspects): Nothing so far 
- [Traits](https://s-20.github.io/unnamed/#/Traits): Nothing so far
- [Skills](https://s-20.github.io/unnamed/#/Skills): Operate-Computer 2 (Focus: Video Games), Medical-Animal 1
- [Connections](https://s-20.github.io/unnamed/#/Connections)
  - *Javier* 3: Best friend; builds computers and is willing to take the fall for you. You owe him, and would die for him
  - *Family* 1: Your mother and sister 

### Special Abilities

At the start of the campaign, you will have one Special Ability at Scale 1 (a Perk); this is the *Something You Can Do* we discussed, listed as [The Perk Question](#the-perk-question), below.

> **Perk: Subtle Battery**<br>
> Things that require batteries never seem to die when you're using them. Things with supposedly dead batteries handed to you turn out to still have a 1% charge.

## Conversation Summary

### The Perk Question

> There is something you can do, a very minor “superpower” — so minor it fails to set off metahuman detection. To you, it is as natural as breathing; so natural, you have gotten this far in your life without thinking it was all that odd. Other people don't generally notice it, and when they do they can write it off. What is it?

**Response**: Powered items that I'm using never seem to completely run out of a charge
