# Gods of Chaos Character Profile

Gods of Chaos is the upcoming play-test for my as-yet unnamed game system. Set in the New Defenders multiverse in a timeline adjacent to the original campaign, the campaign centers around a Game that turns out to be much more serious than you initially thought it would be, and will result in (surviving) characters having full-fledged superpowers. Character death is on the table, although probably not for the first few sessions. There will be investigation, combat, some light horror elements (mildly creepy, not outright scary/horrifying), and other fun stuff.

This is a summary and limited parsing of the conversation(s) we've had about your character so far.

In addition, I have a Character Background Template you can use to fill in some details related to Appearance and History. *Anything* that's on a character sheet for this system can potentially provide a bonus ([Synergy](https:////s-20.github.io/unnamed/#.Synergy)) depending on circumstances, so having more details is better, but it's all up to you.

And, finally, I have a [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/gods-of-chaos-28defenders-multiverse-alpha7CC6A131429-s20) page for the game, although it's very much a work in progress.

### Special Abilities

At the start of the campaign, you will have one Special Ability at Scale 1 (a Perk); this is the *Something You Can Do* we discussed, listed as [The Perk Question](#the-perk-question), below.

## Conversation Summary

### The Perk Question

> There is something you can do, a very minor “superpower” - so minor it fails to set off metahuman detection. To you, it is as natural as breathing; so natural, you have gotten this far in your life without thinking it was all that odd. Other people don't generally notice it, and when they do they can write it off. What is it?
