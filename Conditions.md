# Conditions

Conditions are generally temporary but ongoing problems or benefits that a character has to deal with. Characters might be regenerating, stunned, tired, battered, and so on.

Most conditions are backed up by game mechanics. In addition, it can be fun to actively role-play a Condition. FOr example, a Dazed character could act sort of out of it, responding slowly to inquiry.

## Duration and Stack

By default, Conditions last until the end of your next turn in Combat (or other per-round conflict), or for 1 minute otherwise. Some Conditions have longer durations, and others have specific requirements to come to an end.

Often, however, a Condition will not end on its own, and instead will require some in-game event to end. For example, if you're on fire, you have "Affliction: On Fire" until the fire is put out.

Conditions can usually be stacked - that is, an individual condition can be applied more than once or at a higher strength. This usually means that the Condition lingers longer, going down by 1 at the end of your turn or every minute until its gone. A few Conditions, however, have specific effects at higher stacks. See below.

## Suspending Conditions

You can usually ignore a condition briefly by spending a [Drama Die](DramaDice.md). This usually means for one brief "action" outside of combat, or for one turn in combat. Not all Conditions can be ignored, and there may be consequences for ignoring one.

## Positive Conditions

Positive Conditions are things that benefit your character. These are generally gained through the use of [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), although other circumstances can bring them about as well.

### Positive Condition List

| Condition | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Energized | You're especially energized. Once per round, you may add an additional die to any one check.|
| Fortunate | You're luckier than usual. You can re-roll one die on all checks. You must take the new result, however. |
| Obscured | You're difficult or impossible to detect. You gain a free success on any attempt to go unnoticed. |
| Regenerating | You're healing at a phenomenal rate, removing 1 wound at the end of each turn in combat, and every 5 minutes outside of combat. |
| (Type) Tolerance | You are particularly resistant to something harmful. Any damage you take from sources of that type are reduced by 1 wound, and any checks you make to resist or ignore the noted effect gain a free success. |

## Negative Conditions

Negative Conditions are things you generally try to avoid, and are disadvantageous in some way.

### Negative Condition List

| Condition | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Affliction | The character is taking continuing damage from some source. They could be bleeding out, on fire, doused in acid, etc. They gain 1 Wound per round in combat, or 1 wound per minute ( or faster, at GM discretion) out of combat. This condition covers multiple "sub-conditions" - bleeding, burning, suffocating, etc. - that are mechanically identical, but are ended in different ways. |
| Dazed | The character is distracted, stunned, or dazed in some way, or may be mystically slowed down, or some similar effect. In combat, they lose 1 Action per round. |
| Dying | See [Death](Death.md) for more information on this Condition.  |
| Enraged | In combat you deal 1 additional wound with every melee attack, but you lose dice equal to the stack on any defensive check, or any check requiring clear thought or concentration. |
| Fear | The character is afraid to the point that they have difficulty acting normally. They usually try to get away from the object of their fear, and they lose 1 die on any checks made to approach or interact with the object of their fear per stack. With a stack of 3+, they're panicked and must flee, run around in a mad fugue, or shut down completely, paralyzed with fear. |
| Illness | The character has a disease of some kind. They suffer effects specific to the illness. This is intended for acute infections; chronic afflictions are better handled with [Complications](Complications.md) |
| Impaired (Sense) | One of the character's senses is weak or unavailable. Any checks made to notice things with the affected sense are made with 2 fewer dice. If this reduces the pool to 0, then the character simply doesn't notice anything with that sense. |
| Poisoned | This condition is a catch-all for poisons, toxins, and venom. You suffer effects specific to the poison you're dealing with. |
| Reeling | You've been severely injured. Reduce all dice pools by 1. |
| Unconscious | The character not conscious, and cannot take any actions. In some circumstances, this Condition can be ended by slapping the character, making a loud noise, or otherwise doing something to bring them around. |
