# Conditions

Conditions are generally temporary but ongoing problems or benefits that a character has to deal with. Characters might be regenerating, stunned, tired, battered, and so on.

Most conditions are backed up by game mechanics. More importantly, though, they have role play implications: if your character is Dazed, they won't act the same way as they would if they were not.

Conditions come in two categories - Positive and Negative. Some Conditions can also be stacked. The mechanical consequences of stacking Conditions vary, and not all conditions can be stacked.

You can usually ignore a condition briefly by spending a [Drama Die](DramaDice.md). This usually means for one brief "action" outside of combat, or for one turn in combat. Not all Conditions can be ignored, and there may be consequences for ignoring one.

## Positive Conditions

Positive Conditions are things that benefit your character. These are generally gained through the use of [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), although other circumstances can bring them about as well.

### Positive Condition List

| Condition | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Energized | You're especially energized. Once per round, you may add an additional die to any one check. At 1 stack, it's a d6, at 2 stack it's a d8. Higher stacks just mean a longer duration for the condition. |
| Enraged | In combat you deal 1 additional wound with every melee attack, but you gain 1 automatic failure on any defensive check, or any check requiring clear thought or concentration. Increasing the stack just increases the extra failures on checks and increases the duration of the condition. |
| Fortunate | You're luckier than usual. You can re-roll one Failure per round per stack in this condition. You have to accept the new roll, even if it's another failure. |
| Obscured (Sense) | You're difficult or impossible to detect with one or more senses. You gain bonus d8s to avoid detection by the specified senses equal to the stack of the condition. If your stack is 5+, you cannot be detected with those senses.  |
| Quickened | You act with almost superhuman alacrity. You gain 1 additional Action each round in combat. Higher stack only increases the duration of the effect. |
| Regenerating | You're healing at a phenomenal rate - one Wound every 5 rounds at stack 1. Each additional stack reduces the number of rounds needed to restore a Wound by 1, to a minimum of 1 round per wound healed. |
| Swift | You're unusually fast. When you use an Action to move, you may move one additional interval before accruing penalties per stack in this Condition. Any stack higher than 1 is superhuman. |
| (Type) Tolerance | You are particularly resistant to something harmful. When making a check to resist effect, you can ignore 2 Failures per stack. If your stack reaches 5+, you are immune to that particular effect/attack/hazard. For instance, (Lava) Tolerance 6 means you can go swimming in the caldera of a volcano. |

## Negative Conditions

Negative Conditions are things you generally try to avoid, and are disadvantageous in some way.

### Negative Condition List

| Condition | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Affliction | The character is taking continuing damage from some source. They could be bleeding out, on fire, doused in acid, etc. They gain 1 Wound per round in combat, or 1 wound per minute ( or faster, GM's call) out of combat. Increasing the stack increases the amount of Wounds gained per interval. This condition covers multiple "sub-conditions" - bleeding, burning, suffocating, etc. - that are mechanically identical, but are ended in different ways. |
| Battered | A character is battered when they a large amount of damage all at once (see [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md)). They gain the Off Balance Condition if they don't already have it, and they may gain an associated Affliction (see above). |
| Dying | See [Death](Death.md) for more information on this Condition.  |
| Fear | The character is afraid to the point that they have difficulty acting normally. They usually try to get away from the object of their fear, and they lose 1 die on any checks made to approach or interact with the object of their fear per stack. With a stack of 5+, they're panicked and must flee, run around in a mad fugue, or shut down completely, paralyzed with fear. |
| Illness | The character has a disease of some kind. They suffer effects specific to the illness. This is intended for acute infections; chronic afflictions are better handled with [Complications](Complications.md) |
| Impaired (Sense) | One of the character's senses is weak or unavailable. At 1 stack, the character adds 1 failure to all checks involving that sense. At a stack of 2, they only count successes on a 6+.At a stack of 3, all their dice are d6s, even if they come from [Aspects](Aspects.md), and they cannot [Burn](Burn.md) for the check. 5 or more in the stack means they don't have the sense at all. |
| Off Balance | The character is knocked off balance. Add 1 Failure to their checks as long as they have a stack in this condition. The condition's stack is reduced by 1 after each check, or after a minute or so if they don't make any checks. The character can also take a [Focus Action](Combat.md) to throw off 2 stacks of this Condition. |
| Out of It | The character is distracted, stunned, or dazed in some way, or may be mystically slowed down, or some similar effect. In combat, they lose 1 Action per round per stack. If the stack exceeds the character's number of Actions, they are effectively out of action until they recover. By default, this Condition fades at the end of the character's turn. |
| Poisoned | This condition is a catch-all for poisons, toxins, and venom. You suffer effects specific to the poison you're dealing with. |
| Reeling | You've been severely injured. Reduce all dice pools by 1 until you're less hurt. |
| Unconscious | The character not conscious. 1 stack means asleep or passed out, and they can be aroused with a slap or a loud noise. A stack of 2 means out cold, and 3+ means comatose. If your Unconscious stack reaches 5+, you gain a Dying Condition.  |
| Weak | The character is physically weakened. When making melee attacks, they cannot deal more than 1 Wound of damage. At a stack of 2, any activity involving lifting or otherwise exerting physical force only count 6+ as success. At stack 4, the character is effectively paralyzed, and at stack 5 they're too weak to even breathe without assistance - they gain Dying +1. |

## Condition Duration

Most of the time, a Condition's stack is reduced by 1 during your [Resolve Phase](Combat.md) in combat, or by 1 per minute outside of combat. This is only when a different duration doesn't make more sense, however.

For instance, Illness conditions last until you've kicked the disease, Battered is removed by healing Wounds, and Poisoned is removed after the poison has run its course.

A Condition can sometimes be removed (or have its stack reduced) by burning an [Aspect](Aspects.md) as well.
