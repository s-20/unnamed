# Stunts

When you have more [Effort](Effort.md) on a check than you need, you can spend the extra for Stunts. Stunts can increase damage in combat, provide [Synergy](Synergy.md) for a later check, or other things that indicate you did especially well. All Stunts have to be related directly to the inital check, but otherwise work however you want them to.
