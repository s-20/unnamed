# Stunts

When you have more [Effort](Effort.md) on a check than you need, you can spend the extra for Stunts. Stunts can increase damage in combat, provide [Synergy](Synergy.md) for a later check, or other things that indicate you did especially well. All Stunts have to be related directly to the initial check, but otherwise work however you want them to.

Some common uses for stunts include:

- Gain [Synergy](Synergy.md) for a future related check, or provide Synergy to an ally for a future related check
- Change a hit from normal damage to a Wound (this usually requires 2 extra [Effort](Effort.md))
- Inflict some sort of extra consequence for a hit in combat, or use it to add extra movement or other benefit to your action (knock the enemy prone, maneuver to behind them, etc.)
- Add some other extra benefit to the results (a hacker leaves no traces of their presence on a system, or finds extra incriminating information; a detective finds a new lead; an engineer's design is especially efficient, etc.)

Depending on the desired benefit, you might need more than one extra Effort to pull it off; generally, the more extra effort you can apply to the Stunt, the more impressive the results or the Stunt itself.
