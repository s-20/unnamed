# Engagement

An Engagement (or Full Engagement) is a type of Combat that is high-stakes, tactical, and prolonged. It's not just taking out a few turrets or minions as you run down the hall of the Big Bad's volcano lair - it's a full battle with set pieces and usually multiple opponents. Engagement uses elements like a Battle Map or Range Bands to keep track of where people are, and divides the combat into discrete portions called Rounds, Turns, and Phases.

Engagement is meant for large, climactic battles rather than for every fight you come across. While some campaigns might always use Engagement for fights (because they are rare, or because that's what you're here for), most games should use [Skirmish](Skirmish.md) rules for most fights, which allows for a much faster resolution.

## Rounds, Turns, and Phases

An Engagement is divided into three progressively smaller units of time:

- a **Round** contains all the actions of all the PCs and NPCs over the course of a set period of in-game time. By default, a Round represents 5 seconds of in-game time. All the events of a round are happening more or less at the same time, but an order is enforced to make tactical choices easier to track and to keep things from descending into chaos.
- a **Turn** is when an individual character takes their Actions. When it's your turn, you get two Actions to perform. When it's not your turn, you can use Reactions (a special kind of Action). You can use your actions for **Maneuvers**, **Attacks**, **Defenses** or **Concentration**. Turns can be divided either into Individual Turns (each character has their own turn tracked separately) or Group Turns (more than one character uses the same Turn, arranging their individual actions between them as they see fit). By default, PCs have Individual Turns and NPCs have a single Group Turn.
- a **Phase** is a specific portion of a Turn. Each Turn has three Phases - Start, Declaration, and Resolution. You don't have to pay much attention to Phases, just be aware that they're there. Phases are especially helpful for complex tactics in a Group Turn, and are used to determine when durations start of end.

## Actions

On your turn, you can take Two Actions for free, or Three Actions if you reduce all your DIce Pools until the start of your next turn by 2. You can choose from one of the following Actions, which each describe a wealth of possibilities: *Attack*, *Assist*, *Defend*, *Concentrate*, or *Maneuver*. Each possible Action has its own rules, and can be used to describe multiple things.

Each of the Actions is described in detail below. In addition, there are *Free Actions*, *Prepared Actions*, and *Reactions*, which represent special circumstances.

### Attack

An Attack is any action that's intended to cause harm. If you make an Attack as your first Action and you hit, you can take a second Attack Action to Follow Up at -1 die. If you miss, you can make a second Attack Action at -2 dice. Generally, you have to get 1 [Effort](Effort.md) to hit, and 2 Effort to cause a [Wound](WoundThreshold.md). A hit without a wound usually costs a rank of a [Trait](Traits.md) for a PC, or for [NPCs](NPCs.md), reducing one of their Dice Pools. Things like tripping an opponent, shooting them, or blasting them with a fireball are all Attack Actions, and use the same rules - the effects are what makes sense at the time, plus any appropriate damage.

### Assist

An Assist Action is used to help someone else. You describe what you're doing and how you intend it to help, and make a check. For every 2 Effort you roll, the person you're trying to help gains 1 [Synergy](Synergy.md) on what you're helping them with. This could mean distracting an opponent to make them easier to hit, providing cover for someone, or anything else that involves giving them a hand.

### Concentrate

Concentrate is an Action you take for anything that isn't one of the other Actions. You can use Concentrate to Aim (effectively the Assist action described above, except you're helping you), focus to cast a spell, work on disarming a bomb, or read aloud from a Tome of Ancient Horror as part of a banishing ritual - anything that occupies your attention, but isn't covered by another Action.

### Defend

Taking the Defend Action allows you to make Defensive Checks against attacks made against you. If you take Defense once, you can make any Defensive Rolls you need until the start of your next turn, but every Defense after the first is at a cumulative -2 to the dice pool. If you take two Defend actions, you can make as many Defense checks as you need to without penalty. Effort from your Defense Checks reduces the Effort of an incoming attack at a 1 for 1 rate. If you reduce the Effort of an attack to 0, you aren't hit and can take a free move of up to 2 Squares.

### Maneuver

Maneuver is used to travel across the battlefield. 1 Maneuver allows you to move up to 5 Squares (about 10 meters/yards). If you take two Maneuvers in a row, you can move an additional 2 Squares. If you take three in a row, you're sprinting - move up to an additional 8 Squares (for a total of 20 Squares, or about 40 meters/yards), but until the start of your next turn, anyone attacking you gains 1 Synergy on the check. Maneuver can also be used to dive for cover.

### Free Actions

Some things you do during a fight don't require an action. Generally, you can talk, draw a weapon, move 1 Square (only once, and only if you're not going to use a Maneuver!), Talking is a special case - if you're trying to use conversation to manipulate or inspire someone and a check is involved, then you're taking either an Assist or a Concentration action, not a free talk action. Also, keep in mind that one combat round is only about five seconds long - avoid  extended speeches if you care about verisimilitude.

### Prepared Actions

You can prepare an Action for later,  allowing you to interrupt someone else with an action when a triggering event occurs. To Prepare an Action, you spend the Action and say something along the lines of "If someone attacks Sam, I attack them" or "I'll dive in front of any bullets targeting Lynn". If the triggering event doesn't occur, you lose the prepared action. You can also drop a Prepared Action for a Reaction at any time (see below). Prepared Actions can take place immediately *before* the triggering action, or immediately *after* it, at your discretion. This means it can interrupt the action or respond to it.

### Reactions

Reactions are special actions that Players (PCs) can use when it's not their turn. If you have a Prepared Action, you can drop it for a Reaction. Otherwise, you have to spend a [Drama Die](DramaDice.md) to take a Reaction. A Reaction can be any of the above actions, and it is made without penalty even if you took three Actions on your turn. Reactions are triggered by something, and take place *after* the triggering event - you could shove someone out of the way of a moving car as a Reaction if it was triggered by the car speeding towards them, but not by the car actually hitting them.

Each player can only take one Reaction per round.

## Range Zones

Range Zones represent different distances to targets, and are used to determine what sort of actions you can take related to other characters, the range of weapons, how far you can go using a Maneuver and so on. While they are primarily used as an organizational tool for Range Bands, they're useful with a Battle Map as well.

There are five Range Zones:

- **Close** range indicates anything within three meters/ten feet of you. You can take Close Range Actions targeting anything in Close range without spending an Action to Maneuver closer to the target. If your weapon doesn't reach 10 feet, you get a free step-to-close with your target, moving one square closer on a Battle Map. If you're doing something intended for a longer range zones, you leave yourself Open, which can trigger a Wait action or be taken advantage of with Special Abilities. If someone makes a more distant attack within CLose range of you, they leave themselves Open.
- **Near** range involves anything that  is more than three meters/ten feet, but less than 10 meters/30 feet. You can take Near Range Actions targeting anything in Near or Close range without spending an Action to maneuver closer to the target. You leave yourself Open to anyone in Close range when doing so. If someone makes a more distant attack against someone and they are in Near range of you, they leave themselves Open. One Maneuver will get you from Near to Close range.
- **Far** range is for things that are further than Near range, up to about 100 meters/yards, about Football Field away. You can take Far Range Actions targeting anything in Close, Near, and Far range without spending an Action to Maneuver closer to the target, and you can take Near range Actions against Far Range targets with a 2 die penalty.  You leave yourself open to anyone in Close or Near range when doing so. Two Maneuvers will get you from Close to Far range, and one Maneuver will get you from Near to Far range. Using two Maneuvers in a round leaves you Open.
- **Distant** range is more than a football field away, but still in sight. Not all battlefields will even *have* a Distant range, depending on the size of the battlefield and visibility conditions. You can take Distant Range actions targeting anything in Close, Near, Far, or Distant range without spending an action to Maneuver closer to the target. You leave yourself Open to anyone in Close or Near range when doing so. Two Maneuvers will get you from Near to Distant range. Using two Maneuvers in a round leaves you Open.
- **Tactical** range is for things that are so far away, they aren't even on the battlefield. Tactical range is the province for things like Artillery and Mortar fire, and can be used for things that are so far away, they're not visible without the aid of telescopic tools or effects. You can take a Tactical action against things that are Distant or further away, but you cannot use Tactical actions against anything closer than Distant. Tacking a Tactical action leaves you Open to anyone at Close or Near range.

## Battle Map

A Battle Map is a grid, usually of squares one inch/2 centimeters on a side. Terrain is placed or drawn on the map, and miniatures are used to represent all combatants on the battlefield. Battle Maps can he;p you visualize everyone's position in combat, and can make things like calculating range to a target trivial. Technically speaking, a Battle Map doesn't need to have a grid - you can use a tape measure or a length of string to determine ranges.

For the purpose of this Wiki, we're going to operate under the assumption that you know the basics of how a Battle Map works. Battle Maps can show the position of structures, obstacles, rough terrain, hazards, and so on in addition to marking where everyone is in relation to one another. As a rough guideline:

- **Structures** are things like buildings or walls. The block movement, line of sight, and most other effects. It's not impossible to go *through* a Structure, but it should be very difficult.
- **Obstacles** usually have to be maneuvered around, but can also provide cover and can sometimes be picked up and thrown. Obstacles include furniture, stationary cars, light posts, and statues.
- **Rough Terrain** is difficult to move through, like heavy brush, icy surfaces, steep inclines, and stairs. Each sort of Rough Terrain is different, but it usually takes 3 Squares of movement to go through 2 Squares of rough terrain. Alternately, rough terrain might require a check to keep your footing; if you don't get enough Effort on the check, you fall and lose the rest of your movement.
- **Hazards** are things on the battlefield that are actively dangerous - vats of acid, burning structures, sinkholes, weak floorboards, and traps. The specifics are situational, but usually Hazards need to be avoided, but if they're not you take 1 or more Wound or something even *more interesting* happens. Hazards can also include things like traffic in a busy street, ledges that also count as Rough Terrain, or anything else you can think of.

## Range Bands

This is a feature for a future update (if at all). The general idea is a simple diagram kept by each player showing their relative range to each other combatant.
