# Core Mechanics

The unnamed system is a dicepool based system where you roll a collection of six-sided dice and count results above a certain threshold (almost always results of 5 or 6) to generate [Effort](Effort.md). If you have enough Effort, you succeed at what you’re doing. If you don’t have enough Effort, you might succeed anyway, but at a cost: if the story or game would stall because you outright failed, then you succeed, you just don’t do a good job of it.

## Characteristics

[Characteristics](Characteristics.md) are the resources that make up a character and outline their general and specific abilities. You use them to describe your character and generate your dice pools. You generate dice pools by Pulling a Characteristic into a roll, [Burning](Burn.md) a Characteristic for extra effort, and finding any [Synergy](Synergy.md) you can with other Characteristics, the environment, or the actions of other PCs.

Characteristics are divided into different types:

- **[Aspects](Aspects.md)** represent broad important strengths and concepts about the character, and are tailored to each character. They are analogous to concepts like *class*, *profession*, or *heritage*, but are more flexible and descriptive.
- **[Traits](Traits.md)** represent broad areas of talent or development, indicating if a character is particularly *Strong*, *Agile*, *Clever*, or even *Lucky*. Traits are adjectives you could use to describe the character in a general sense.
- **[Skills](Skills.md)** are things a character knows about or how to do through talent or training. Skills are made by combining two words — an Adjective or Verb and a Noun — to create a descriptive phrase, like *Religious-Lore* or *Technological-Sabotage*.
- **[Connections](Connections.md)** are things that connect a character to the world around them, like shared experiences, people, or organizations. Connections are tailor made for each character, and can be things like *Stormed the beaches at Normandy*, *Friends with Bob Mirrorshades at MegaCorp, Inc*, or *From Florida and Proud of that fact for some reason*.

## Statistics

[Statistics](Statistics.md) are also resources, but they are sperated from the core Characteristics because they operate under different rules, both during character creation and during the game. They might be used differently, or they might be highly specific to an individual setting, campaign, or even a single character. Outside to Wound Threshold and Stuff, not all characters will have all statistics, and some might not even exist in a given game.

- **[Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md)** are things a character can do that are beyond the abilities of mortal man. That is, Special Abilities represent things like *psychic ability*, *magic*, *cybernetics* or *superpowers*.
- **[Energy](Energy)** is a collection of sub-characteristics that represent pools of potential ability that fuel Special Abilities, like *magic points* or *willpower*.
- **[Details](Details.md)** are little things about the character that rarely come up, but can provide a small benefit when they do. Things like *studied Renaissance poetry*, *knows a few obscure computer languages*, or *always carries a pocket knife* are examples.
- **[Tangles](Tangles.md)** are specific weaknesses or other things that can make a character’s life more difficult when they come up.
- **[Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md)** represents a character’s ability to sustain physical trauma, and any resistances they have to the same.
- **[Stuff](Stuff.md)** is not exactly a Characteristic; instead, it’s a listing of significant possessions, including *cash on hand and credit*, *property*, *special equipment*, *weapons*, and other things you think it’s important to have.

### Presumption of Competence

Characters in the unnamed system are assumed to be generally competent. While there are exceptions (you probably aren’t competent at Quantum Physics without appropriate Characteristics), characters know how to do all the regular stuff you’d expect a person in their world to be able to do. This means, for instance, that you don’t need a rank in the Strong Trait to help push a car up a hill, but you can help more if you *do* have it.

If you have even one rank in something, that means you’re good at it; average is no ranks, and being actually bad at something is a [Tangle](Tangles.md).

### Pulling Dice

When you use a Characteristic to make a check, you “pull” it into the check. You can only pull a given type of Characteristic into a check once — that is, each dice pool can be made up of one Aspect, one Trait, one Skill, and so on. Characteristics that you pull into a check provide one die per Rank, so if you pulled *Strong* and *Martial-Combat 2* into a check, you would have 3 dice.

You can pull individual Characteristics as often as you like from check to check. Some Characteristics provide [Synergy](Synergy.md) instead of dice, which can give you benefits other than adding dice to the roll.

### Burning Characteristics

You can get extra umph for a check by [Burning](Burn.md) a Characteristic. Burning a characteristic allows you to pull it into a check even if you’ve already pulled that type of Characteristic. For instance, you could pull a second Trait into a check by burning it. Burning a Characteristic may also provide other effects, like avoiding serious damage.

A burned characteristic is temporarily weakened — its rank is reduced by 1 after the check. You can only Burn characteristics down to a Rank of 1, meaning Characteristics can only be Burned if they have a rank of at least 2. These characteristics are restored over time and depending on the narrative; sometimes they are restored in the next scene, sometimes only after the characters get a chance to rest for an evening, and sometimes only after a significant amount of time has passed.

### Synergy

[Synergy](Synergy.md) is a special benefit that applies when things come together beneficially. It can be claimed from beneficial circumstances, having a high enough ranked Skill related to what you’re doing, a Detail that applies to the situation, the assistance of an ally, and other things that generally give you a better handle on the situation.

### Drama Dice

[Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) are a shared resource that the players can use to improve their chances of success or to affect a scene. Drama Dice are Burned as they’re used, reducing the available pool of dice, but can be restored through in-game actions like [Entangling](Tangles.md) a scene or check, great role-playing, completing personal or group goals, and so on.

## Collective Judgment

Characteristics operate under the principle of *collective judgment*. This means that the individual characteristic means what the game group thinks it means, rather than some predefined and carefully outlined list of rules. If the GM or the group in general think it applies to a situation, then it can be used. Use cases should be kept generally consistent, but can change if your group thinks they apply in unusual circumstances.

Your characteristics should be fairly obvious in meaning and applications most of the time. We can all agree that *Strong* represents physical prowess and can be used to lift heavy weights and apply force, for example. There might be times, however, where something might appear to apply to this specific moment even if it wouldn't normally, or a given group might decide that a characteristic implies something more than the obvious. Maybe in your group *Strong* also implies a certain physical will, the psychological and physical ability to push one's self harder to improve, the way you've done while working out to get additional ranks in the Trait.

That's all good; that's the system working as intended. Words have specific meaning, but they also have connotation and subtext for different people. If the group in general thinks that a particular application makes sense based on your justification or your collective judgment, then that's how it works.

## Non Player Characters

The GM's job is difficult enough without having to build full character sheets or memorize/reference huge and complication data blocks for each creature you encounter. NPCs in unnamed use different, more streamlined rules for this reason. A Non-Player Character is made up of things they're good at (Fortes), and things they're less good at, but still know a bit about (Talents) and a few notes for other things. They also have a [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md) like the PCs, although it might be larger or smaller depending on how tough the character is.

See [Non-Player Characters](NPCs.md) for more information.
