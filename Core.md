# Core Mechanics

The unnamed system is a dicepool-based system where you roll a collection of dice and count results above a certain threshold (almost always results of 5 or 6) to generate [Effort](Effort.md). If you have enough Effort, you succeed at what you’re doing. If you don’t have enough Effort, you might succeed anyway, but at a cost: if the story or game would stall because you outright failed, then you succeed, you just don’t do a good job of it.

That’s about it for the core resolution mechanic. Everything else spins out from there.

## Characteristics

[Characteristics](Characteristics.md) are the resources that make up a character and outline their general and specific abilities. You use them to describe your character and generate your dice pools. You generate dice pools by Pulling a Characteristic into a roll, [Burning](Burn.md) a Characteristic for extra effort, and finding any [Synergy](Synergy.md) you can with other Characteristics, the environment, or the actions of other PCs.

Characteristics in unnamed are *descriptive* in that they help describe a character’s approach to interacting with the world. Characteristics are also open to *collective judgment* - that is, although what they represent may be obvious, how they are used is up to the group.

Characteristics are divided into several different types:

- **[Aspects](Aspects.md)** represent broad important strengths and concepts about the character, and are tailored to each character. They are analogous to concepts like *class*, *profession*, or *heritage*, but are more flexible.
- **[Traits](Traits.md)** represent broad areas of talent or development, indicating if a character is particularly *Strong*, *Agile*, *Clever*, or even *Lucky*. Traits are generally adjectives you could use to describe the character in a general sense.
- **[Skills](Skills.md)** are things a character knows about or how to do through talent or training, and are more specific than Traits. Skills are made by combining two words - an Adjective or Verb and a Noun - to create a descriptive phrase, like *Religious-Lore* or *Technological-Sabotage*.
    - **[Focus](Focus.md)** is a sub-characteristics that indicates a much more specific area of expertise, like *Fencing* or *Hacking*.
- **[Connections](Connections.md)** are things that connect a character to the world around them, like shared experiences, people, or organizations. Connections are tailor made for each character, and can be things like *Stormed the beaches at Normandy*, *Friends with Bob Mirroshades at MegaCorp, Inc*, or *Made man in the Italian Mafia*.
- **[Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md)** are things a character can do that are beyond the abilities of mortal man. That is, Special Abilities represent things like *psychic ability*, *magic*, *cybernetics* or *super powers*.
    - **[Energy](Energy)** is a collection of sub-characteristics that represent pools of potential ability that fuel Special Abilities, like *magic points* or *willpower*.
- **[Details](Details.md)** are little things about the character that rarely come up, but can provide a small benefit when they do. Thinks like *studied Renaissance poetry*, *knows an obscure computer language*, or *always carries a pocket knife, even when you think she wouldn’t have one* are examples.
- **[Tangles](Tangles.md)** are specific weaknesses or other things that can make a character’s life more difficult when they come up.
- **[Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md)** represents a character’s ability to sustain physical trauma, and any resistances they have to the same.
- **[Stuff](Stuff.md)** is not exactly a Characteristic; instead, it’s a listing of significant possessions, including *cash on hand and credit*, *property*, *special equipment*, *weapons*, and other things you think it’s important to have.

### Presumption of Competence

Characters in the unnamed system are assumed to be generally competent at most things. While there are exceptions (you probably aren’t competent at Quantum Physics without Characteristics that reflect that fact), characters know how to do all the regular stuff you’d expect a person in their world to be able to do. This means, for instance, that you don’t need a rank in the Strong Trait to help push a car up a hill, but you can help more if you *do* have it.

If you have even one rank in something, that means you’re good at it; average is no ranks, and being actually bad at something is a Tangle. 

### Pulling Dice

When you use a Characteristic to make a check, you “pull” it into the check. You can only pull a given type of Characteristic into a check once - that is, each dice pool can be made up of one Aspect, one Trait, one Skill, and so on. Characteristics that you pull into a check provide one die, unless they have a Rank, in which case they provide that many dice for the check. So if your pulled *Strong* and *Martial-Combat 2* into a check, you would have 3 dice.

You can pull individual Characteristics as often as you like from check to check. Some Characteristics provide [Synergy](Synergy.md) instead of dice, which can give you benefits other than adding dice to the roll.

### Burning Characteristics

You can get extra dice for a check by [Burning](Burn.md) a Characteristic. Buring a characteristic allows you to pull it into a check even if you’ve already pulled that type of Characteristics. For instance, you could pull a second Trait into a check by burning it. Burning a Characteristic may also provide other effects, like avoiding serious damage.

A burned characteristic is temporarily weakened - its rank is reduced by 1 after the check. You can only Burn characteristics down to a Rank of 1, meaning Characteristics can only be Burned if they have a rank of at least 2. These characteristics are restored over and depending on the narrative - sometimes they are restored in the next scene, sometimes only after the characters get a chance to rest for an evening, and sometimes only after a significant amount of time has passed.

You can usually only Burn Aspects, Traits, Skills and Connections. 

### Synergy

[Synergy](Synergy.md) is a special benefit that applies when things come together in a beneficial way. Synergy can be claimed from beneficial circumstances, having a high enough ranked Skill related to what you’re doing, a Detial that applies to the situation, the assistance of an ally, and other things that generally give you a better handle on the situation.

Synergy can give you one of several benefits to a check, like a bonus die or extra Effort if you roll enough Effort to succeed without the Synergy. If you gather enough Synergy, you can claim even greater benefits, like free Effort on the check or restored Drama Dice.

### Drama Dice

[Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) are a shared resource that the players can use to improve their chances of success or to affect a scene. Drama Dice are Burned as they’re used, reducing the available pool of dice, but can be restored through in-game actions like [Entangling](Tangles.md) a scene or check, great roleplaying, completing personal or group goals, and so on.
