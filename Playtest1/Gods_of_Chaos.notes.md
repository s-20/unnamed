# Gods of Chaos Notes

## Elements of Power

- **Quirks** - the small power everyone selects during the lead-up conversation
- **Sigil** - A "daily" power that also resets at Momentum 5 (although players don't know that); powerful, but can't affect anyone not in the Game. Based on their "gamer type"
- **Arma** - The player's designated weapon or defence item. Chosen when you sign up, you can choose to put Power-ups in them to extend the Power-up's duration, but then the power-up can't be used outside of game Combat. Can also be Upgraded at a Forge.
- **Power-ups** - Powers bought with Jewels, the in-game currency. Chosen from a list, temporary, generally more powerful ones have a shorter duration or a limited number of uses
- **Sanctuaries** - Use to declare a 100' zone off-limits to hostile action; taking Hostile Action in a Sanctuary results in an immediate game over. Lasts for 12 hours once purchased. Costs 20 Jewels, or 1 Diamond to make a permanent Sanctuary zone.
- **Upgrades** - Last for the duration of the game, bought with Diamonds or discovered in-game. Each Upgrade costs one more diamond than the last, although this doesn't apply to using a Forge. Whether you get to keep them after the game is unknown.
- **Cash-Outs** - Convert Jewels into real money... which you'll need, since all your accounts just got locked!\
- **Undo** - Available for 5 Diamonds, this allows you to reset time - you can go back to the start of a battle or the start of a scene, or you can go back further and ahve an hour to set up something, after which you go back to where you were

## Game Currency

* **Jewels** - The basic currency that you can easily get in game. You'll find them just lying around, and you get them as awards for basically every accomplishment in game. They can be cashed out - each Jewel is worth $500. Used in game to buy Power-Ups and Sanctuaries.
* **Diamonds** - Premium currency, available for purchase in-app for $10,000. Found (very rarely) in game as well. Everyone gets one Diamond when they begin the game. Diamonds can be cashed out for $5,000.

## Special Geography

* **Forge** - A place where Arma can be upgraded. You can only use a given forge once, and doing so costs you a Diamond.
* **Safe Zones** - Permanent Sanctuaries. Located in businesses like coffee shops, hospitals, and places of worship. No abilities besides Quirks work in Safe Zones, and Arma vanish while you're in them. Spending money in a Safe Zone earns you Jewels - spending $50 gets you 1 Jewel once per day. Other specials exists (for instance: Order a Soy Cappuccino with a triple shot and three pumps of hazelnut to get 2 Jewels.)

## Opposing Players

* **The Florist** - Plant Control sigil
* **North Wind** - Wind Control sigil that's been upgraded to also control any missile in flight - one activation lasts a whole scene
* **The Undertaker** - Sigil can animate any dead (including Game Overs) within 100 yards; upgraded to give her two persistent bodyguards
* **Newbz** - New players who, basically, suck; make something up on the fly, use Skirmish rules unless they're in a clan and attacking en masse
