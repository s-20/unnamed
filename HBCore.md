# unnamed System Core Rules

The unnamed System has a lot of moving parts, but everything builds off of a fairly simple set of rules. There are two primary conceits at work in the system: the Core Mechanics (representing how you use the crunch of the system) and the Operating Principles (the general idea behind how those rules are used).

## Core Mechanics

### The Dice

The System uses dice pools composed of d6s to determine success and failure. Dice come in a few *types*, the most common of which are Easy, Normal, or Hard. Easy dice get a success on a 4+, normal dice get a Success on a 5+, and Hard dice get a success on a 6 only.

There are also Half Dice, Simple Dice, [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md), and other special kinds. See [Dice Types](DiceTypes.md) for a full rundown.

Generally, you only need 1 **success** to do something. Especially difficult challenges or unusual circumstances might push the requirement to 2 or even higher. Any successes that you get beyond what you need mean you did really well. This means something specific in [Combat](Combat.md), and often has an effect on [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), but you usually just get to describe yourself being cool, finishing faster than expected, putting an extra flourish on things, et cetera.

Even if you have no **Successes**, you may still succeed in some small way, but with a drawback of some kind, depending on the situation. This is **Failing Forward**.

Results of 1 are called **quirks**. If you have more **quirks** than successes, something strange or unexpected occurs along with however well you succeed; either you or the GM will describe what happens.

If you have **quirks** and no **successes**, you outright fail, and if you have nothing but **quirks**, then you fail and something really strange or bad happens (called a **twist**). You or the GM will come up with something interesting, and then move on.

### Pulling Characteristics

In order to make a check, you gather your resources, adding whichever **characteristics** make sense to the pool. This is called **Pulling** the individual **statistic**, i.e. **Pulling a Trait** or **Pulling a Connection**, et al.

Each statistic pulled adds dice to the check equal to its stack. Some Statistics can be [Burned](Burn.md) instead of just being pulled.

Which Statistics you pull for a particular Check are usually up to the player. While the GM might sometimes ask for something specific, they will more frequently provide a prompt for a check, or the Player can declare an action whenever they'd like. The player then decides the best way to resolve it. The GM then approves the check, sometimes asking for clarifications or suggesting changes.

### Check Example

*Amina's character Jamie the Thief is trying to open a safe, and she wants to use his Nimble, Perceptive, and Clever Traits in combination with his Security skill.*

*She says "I **put my ear to the safe and listen carefully** as I turn the dial with my **nimble** fingers. I'm **clever** enough to do this quickly, and **I know my way around safes**." She then throws 4d6 and gets 1, 4, 5, 6 - two successes - more than she needed! Amina says "I got it, and I'm so good I popped it in just a couple seconds!"*

## Modifiers

You can modify your rolls, either adding or removing dice, to reflect special circumstances or specific results you need to achieve. These Modifiers can add a die to your roll, or subtract a die from a roll.

Modifiers are primarily under player control, with the GM providing approval. The GM might throw a penalty at you, but typically if circumstances are especially difficult for you, the GM will require more than one success rather than steal a die from your roll.

Other players or the GM can also award an extra die if your description is especially cool, the idea is especially interesting or fun, or if you do something especially in character or that adds significantly to the story.

### Sample Modifiers

Here are a few examples for modifiers, both positive and negative. These are just meant to get your mind working, and are not an exhaustive list.

- **Positive Modifiers**
  - I have access to really good tools, so I'll add a die
  - I'm going to take my time to make sure I do it right; I'll add a die
  - I'm attacking from the high ground, that should be good for a die
- **Negative Modifiers**
  - I know it's too dark to see, but maybe I can try to pick the lock by feel - I'll drop a die to try
  - I need to get this done in a hurry, I'll drop a die to do it in half the time
  - The tree is too skinny to hide behind, but maybe if I suck in my gut and roll 1 less die, he won't notice me

### Drama Dice
 
[Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) are a special shared expendable pool of dice the players have to add modifiers to their checks, and to do a variety of other things. A group's Drama Dice pool starts at 5 dice, and changes throughout the game. All players share the same Drama Dice pool.

See the linked article for more information.

## Burn

You can **burn** an [Aspect](Aspects.md), [Trait](Traits.md), or [Connection](Connections.md) to push yourself. Essentially, the character puts their all into something, and is a bit worn out because of it.

Burning a statistic means that any successes you roll for it are doubled. This means that if you roll an even number for any burned statistic, you get two successes, and if you roll a 6 for an Aspect, you get 4 successes.

When a statistic is burned, its stack is temporarily reduced by 1. If its stack is reduced to 0, you can no longer pull that statistic until it recovers completely.
