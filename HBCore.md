# unnamed Introduction

The unnamed system is a Tabletop Role Playing Game (TTRPG) designed to be adaptable to nearly any genera of play. The idea is to establish a core system of rules that can then expanded as needed to cover genre conventions, but is playable nearly anywhere out of the box.

The system itself is based on collecting d6 dice into Dice Pools, rolling those pools, and counting "Effort" - usually dice results of 5 or 6. The more Effort you get from a roll, the greater your success, and the more control you have over the outcome.

Sometimes things are difficult, and require a Minimum Effort - that is, a certain amount of Effort - before you can call what you did completely successful, although all checks yield results of some kind.

Sometimes things can go oddly, or the unexpected can crop up. If you roll more 1s (called "Quirks") than you do Effort, something strange or perhaps even harmful happens. If all your dice come up Quirks, then something happens to make your situation more difficult, and you fail at what you're doing unless that would impede the story.

## Characteristics

Characters in unnamed are made up of Characteristics - [Aspects](Aspects.md), [Traits](Traits.md), [Skills](Skills.md), and [Connections](Connections.md). (There are a few other Characteristics, but these four are the big ones). When you use a Characteristic in a check, it is called "Pulling" the characteristic.

!> The Supporting Cast of a game (the NPCs, in other words) don't usually have Characteristics. Instead, they have an [Action Pool](NPC_ActionPool.md), one or more [Talents](NPC_Talents.md), and maybe a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md).

### Aspects

Aspects are short phrases, usually limited to three words, that describe some major aspect of your character. A few examples might be "Damn Good Pilot", "Retired Police Detective", or "Elven Spellsinger". Aspects are used to cover things like professions, major talents, ancestry, and other such things that imply a wide range of expertise. An Aspect can be pulled into any check it seems to apply to.

When you can pull an Aspect into a check, it does not provide dice. Instead, you can re-roll any Quirks that come up, with the new roll replacing the old one.

### Traits and Skills

[Traits](Traits.md) and [Skills](Skills.md) provide Dice for the pool. For example, if you have a Strength Trait of 2 and a Melee Combat skill of 2, you could pull them both for a "power attack" and gain 4 dice for the check.

Although you can normally only use one Characteristic of each type, you can add an additional Characteristic to a check by [Burning it](Burn.md) - this provides additional dice, but at a cost.

#### Foci

Foci are a subset of Skills; essentially, while Skills are broad and cover a lot of ground, a Focus is very specific. For example, while there is a Athletics skill that covers all sorts of physical activity, a character might have a Focus in a particular sport.

A Focus is pulled like any other characteristic, but it does not add dice. Instead, if you pull a Focus into a check, you gain 1 Effort to your result if you roll at least one effort.
