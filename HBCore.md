# unnamed Introduction

The unnamed system is a Tabletop Role Playing Game (TTRPG) designed to be adaptable to nearly any genera of play. The idea is to establish a core system of rules that can then expanded as needed to cover genre conventions, but is playable nearly anywhere out of the box.

The system itself is based on collecting d6 dice into Dice Pools, rolling those pools, and counting "[Effort](Effort.md)" - usually dice results of 5 or 6. The more [Effort](Effort.md) you get from a roll, the greater your success, and the more control you have over the outcome.

Sometimes things are difficult, and require a Minimum [Effort](Effort.md) - that is, a certain amount of [Effort](Effort.md) - before you can call what you did completely successful, although all checks yield results of some kind.

Sometimes things can go oddly, or the unexpected can crop up. If you roll more 1s (called "Quirks") than you do [Effort](Effort.md), something strange or perhaps even harmful happens. If all your dice come up Quirks, then something happens to make your situation more difficult, and you fail at what you're doing unless that would impede the story. The actual *result* is up to the player, however - things went **very** wrong - but how?

## Characteristics

Mechanically speaking, characters in unnamed are made up of Characteristics. The four Primary characteristics are [Aspects](Aspects.md), [Traits](Traits.md), [Skills](Skills.md), and [Connections](Connections.md). When you use a Characteristic in a check, it is called "Pulling" the characteristic.

!> The Supporting Cast of a game (the NPCs, in other words) don't usually have Characteristics. Instead, they have an [Action Pool](NPC_ActionPool.md), one or more [Talents](NPC_Talents.md), and maybe a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md).

### Aspects

Aspects are short phrases, usually limited to three words, that describe some major aspect of your character. A few examples might be "Damn Good Pilot", "Retired Police Detective", or "Elven Spellsinger". Aspects are used to cover things like professions, major talents, ancestry, and other such things that imply a wide range of expertise. An Aspect can be pulled into any check it seems to apply to.

When you can pull an Aspect into a check, it does not provide dice. Instead, you can re-roll any Quirks that come up, with the new roll replacing the old one.

### Traits and Skills

[Traits](Traits.md) and [Skills](Skills.md) provide Dice for the pool. For example, if you have a Strength [Trait](Trait.md) of 2 and a Melee Combat [Skill](Skills.md) of 2, you could pull them both for a "power attack" and gain 4 dice for the check.

Although you can normally only use one Characteristic of each type, you can add an additional Characteristic to a check by [Burning it](Burn.md) - this provides additional dice, but at a cost.

#### Foci

[Foci](Foci.md) are a subset of [Skill](Skills.md)s; essentially, while [Skills](Skills.md) are broad and cover a lot of ground, a [Focus](Foci.md) is very specific. For example, while there is an Athletics [Skill](Skills.md) that covers all sorts of physical activity, a character might have a [Focus](Foci.md) in a particular sport.

A [Focus](Foci.md) is pulled like any other characteristic, but it does not add dice. Instead, if you pull a [Focus](Foci.md) into a check, you gain [Effort](Effort.md) to your result if you roll at least one [Effort](Effort.md).

### Connections

[Connections](Connections.md) are things that tie the character to the world they are in. [Connections](Connections.md) come in several forms. They can represent a particular contact, membership within an organization, a shared experience, or anything else that grounds the character in the world. A few examples of good Connections include:

- **WWII Veteran**: I served in Her Majesty's Army, and stormed the beaches at Normandy.
- **Friend: Barry Hughs, Reporter**: Barry works for the Times, and is often willing to help me track things down
- **10 years sober AA member**: I carry my 10 year coin and attend regular meetings
- **Survived the Blue Event**: I was there when the Blue Event occurred, and I gained superpowers just like the other survivors.

All of these things represent connections to other people or the world that you might rely on of a number of different things. Connections can be pulled into a check, providing dice just like [Skills](Skills.md) and [Traits](Traits.md).

More importantly, however, they open up role playing opportunities and options that might not have been present before. In the examples above, WWII veteran could get you an in with other vets, Barry could use *his* connections at the Times to get you info or an invitation to an event, being an AA member in good standing can make you seem more trustworthy in the eyes of other AA members, and the Blue Event connections might be required for and used to power [Super Powers](SpecialAbilities.md).

### Other Characteristics

There are a few other characteristics, listed below with links to their more complete descriptions.

- **[Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md)**: Your character's capacity to survive physical trauma without falling unconscious or otherwise being mostly or completely incapacitated. By default, this value is 3.
- **[Details](Details.md)**: Little things about the character that can come in handy in the rare occasion that they come up, usually worth extra [Effort](Effort.md)
- **[Tangles](Tangles.md)**: Things that make the character's life more difficult, although they can sometimes help you out in a strange way. Used primarily to regain [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md).
- **[Stuff](Stuff.md)**: Things you always (or usually) have on you, things you rely on to ply your trade, and things that give you special bonuses of some kind.

## Nothing's Critical

Although unnamed provides ways to be very successful at things you do, and also ways to fail in impressive fashion, it does not have a "critical success/failure system".

There is no "automatic success" if you roll enough [Effort](Effort.md). Some things are just impossible in context - it doesn't matter how charismatic you are, that dragon isn't going to sleep with you. That said, you generally don't properly fail a check unless doing so would be interesting and/or won't derail the game.

In a similar fashion, however, there is no "automatic failure". Sure, if you roll all Quirks on a check, something dramatic and bad might happen, but that doesn't mean you necessarily *failed* at what you were trying to do. Maybe you stopped the reactor meltdown but got a lethal dose of radiation in the process. Maybe you picked the lock, but broke your tools and left obvious evidence of tampering.

The point is that neither extreme - success or failure - can be used to derail the plot. Moreover, as far as automatic success goes, it's kinda always present when it needs to be - you'll never fail at something you know how to do if failing would derail the plot. It's just that your victory might be phyrric.

## Using this Wiki and Contacting its Creator

This Wiki is divided into different articles, most of them kept to the point and short. Just follow the links to any terms you don't know, and you'll find the rules governing them. There's also an index, either in the left sidebar (on desktop) or under the Hamburger menu on the bottom left (on mobile).

My suggestion is to follow one of the links already present on this page, or dive right into [Making a Character](CCSummary.md).

If you're interested in providing feedback or you just want to follow the project, by far the best way is to do so on [Github](https://github.com/s-20/unnamed). You can file an Issue easily enough, and doing so is a big help. If you want to help in a more direct fashion, I can add you to the project, but I'm not really interested in getting more contributors until the game is in a more complete state.

There are [several other ways to get in touch with me](https://wheretofind.me/@s20) if Github isn't your thing. I also have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/ggdfv7M) that you can join - this link is for a temp membership, but if you want to stay, just ask for a role.
