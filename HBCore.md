# Unnamed System Core Rules

This page describes the core dice mechanics of the Unnamed System.

## Dice Basics

The System uses dice pools composed of d6s and d8s to determine success and failure. Any roll of 5 or higher is a **Success**. Any roll of 7 or higher **Bounces** - you count the success and then roll the die again.

Any result of 1 counts as a **Failure**; failures and successes cancel each other out. If you have no successes and no failures, you kinda fail, but only barely and you do make progress. If you have more Failures than Successes, you fail at what you're doing. If you roll all Failures, then it's a **Disaster**.

## Pulling Dice

In order to make a check, you gather your resources, adding whichever dice make sense to the pool. This is called "Pulling Dice".

Pulling Dice involves describing your action, including your [Aspects](Aspects.md), [Traits](Traits.md), and [Skills](Skills.md) in the description. For each Aspect you include, you add d8s equal to its stack. For each Trait or Skill you include, add d6s equal to their respective stack.

Once you've described what you're trying to do and gathered your dice, you roll. Circumstances can sometimes reduce or increase your dice pool.

## Degrees of Success

If all you need is a quick pass/fail, then one success is enough. Otherwise, the following table describes how things work out.

| Successes/Failures | Check Result | Description |
| :------------------- | :-------------------: | :-------------------------------------------- |
| All Failures | Disaster! | Something has gone horribly wrong. |
| No successes, some Failures | Failure | You can't do it, for whatever reason. Depending on the task, you may or may not be able to try again. |
|  No successes, no failures  | Marginal Failure | You failed, but you made progress. In what way? |
| 1 Success | Success with a twist | You accomplished your goal, but it didn't run smoothly - what happened? |
| 2 Successes | Success | You accomplish your goal. Kinda the most boring possible result. |
| 3 or more Successes | Triumph! | You accomplish your goal, with style! The more successes, the better the results. |

### Check Example

*Amina's character Jamie the Thief is trying to open a safe, and she wants to use his Nimble, Perceptive, and Clever Traits in combination with his Security skill.*

*She says "I **put my ear to the safe and listen carefully** as I turn the dial with my **nimble** fingers. I'm **clever** enough to do this quickly, and **I know my way around safes**." She then throws 4d6 and gets 1, 4, 5, 6 - two successes and one Failure. The Failure cancels one of the successes, leaving her with only marginal success. Amina says "I got it, but it took twice as long as I thought it would."*

## Modifiers

In favorable circumstances, you might get a Bonus to your roll. A Bonus usually comes in the form of a d6 added to the roll.

Penalties are handled by adding a Failure to the result of your check. Especially bad circumstances might add two Failures, but that's usually as far as it goes.

If the circumstances would call for both a bonus and a penalty, they cancel each other out.

### Burn

**See [Burn](Burn.md) for more details**

Sometimes you have to really push yourself to try to accomplish something. This is presented by "burning" an Aspect or Trait. Essentially, the character puts their all into something, and is a bit worn out because of it.

The [Burn](Burn.md) article has more detail, but the short version is that burning a [Trait](Traits.md) means it provides d8s for your dice pool instead of d6s, while burning an [Aspect](Aspects.md) provides a free success in addition to the dice it already provides.

When a Trait or Aspect is burned, it's stack is temporarily reduced by 1. You restore the characteristic with rest, relaxation, or some other kind of recuperation. If your character's a partier, they might need to go to a party for instance - whatever charges their batteries.

### Stunts

**For More Information**: [Stunts](Stunts.md)

When making checks, especially good description merits a bonus. If you come up with an especially dramatic or cool way to describe what you're doing, you may be awarded a Stunt Die to add to your check.

## Drama Dice

**For More Information**: [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md)

At the start of a campaign, a pool of Drama Dice is established. This is a pool of d6s equal to 2 for each player at the table, +2 per [Tier](Advancement.md). Any time a player is making a check, they may add one or two Drama Dice to that check.

All player characters usually share the same pool of Drama Dice. Drama Dice replenish slowly on their own, but can be restored faster through good roleplay.
