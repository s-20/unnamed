# Adjustment Points

UNDER REVIEW

Adjustment Points are used to make modifications to a character during [Advancement](Advancement.md). Each session, one or more Adjustment Points is given to the group based on a consensus of the group. While there are no hard an fast rules for how many Adjustment Points the characte

## Making Adjustments

Adjustment points can be spent on a variety of different things. Different Adjustments have different costs, ranging from 10 Adjustment Points down to 1.

Each section below describes the costs and benefits for spending Adjustment Points. Although all changes should be discussed with the GM, the player is meant to have a lot of latitude here.

### 10 Adjustment Points

For 10 points, you can:

- **Improve an Aspect**: Increase the Stack of an Aspect by 1.
- **Add a New Aspect**: You can add an additional Aspect.
- **Improve Wound Threshold**: Increase your Wound Threshold by 1.

### 5 Adjustment Points

For 5 Adjustment Points, you can:

- **Improve a [Trait](Traits.md) or [Skill](Skills.md)**: Increase the stack of an existing Trait or Skill by 1, or add a new Skill or Trait.

### 2 Adjustment Points

For 2 Adjustment Points, you can:

- **Improve a [Connection](Connections.md)**: Increase the stack of a Connection by 1, or add a new Connection. After the game begins, there usually has to be an in-game justification for this improvement
- **Gain a [Specialty](Skills.md)**: Gain a Specialty for a skill.

### 1 Adjustment Point

For 1 Adjustment Point, you can:

- **Add a Detail**: You can add a new [Detail](Details.md) if it makes sense to do so.

You can also spend Adjustment Points to improve things like [Energy Pools](Energy.md), if you have such a thing. The cost depends on if it is a pool or a capacity, and what the pool is for. See [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) for more information.

## Holding Off

You don't have to spend all of your Adjustment Points as soon as you get them. Instead, you can hold some or all in reserve for later. You can do this to save up for a higher cost purchase, or to tweak your character in play.

### Tweaks

Adjustment Points can be spent at any time to make little changes to your character. You can even spend them in the middle of a session, if you like!

In session, you should justify the expenditure in some way, even if it's just an offhand comment ("Yeah, I've been studying Nambian history in my spare time").

### Bigger Purchases

This one is pretty self explanatory. You can hold onto Adjustment Points until you have enough to make the change you want to make. For example, if you have only 2 points, but you want to increase your Wound Threshold, you can save them until you get 8 more.
