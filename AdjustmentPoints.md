# Adjustment Points

Adjustment Points are used to make modifications to a character, either during [Character Creation](CCSummary.md) or during [Advancement](Advancement.md).

During Character Creation, you are awarded 15 Adjustment Points to modify your character. You can gain additional points when you [Advance](Advancement.md)

## Making Adjustments

Adjustment points can be spent on a variety of different things. Different Adjustments have different costs, ranging from 10 Adjustment Points down to 1.

Each section below describes the costs and benefits for spending Adjustment Points. Although all changes should be discussed with the GM, the player is meant to have a lot of latitude here.

### 10 Adjustment Points

For 10 points, you can:

- **Improve an Aspect**: Increase the Stack of an Aspect by 1.
- **Add a New Aspect**: You can add an additional Aspect. Characters cannot have more Aspects than [Tier +1](Advancement.md).
- **Improve Wound Threshold**: Increase your Wound Threshold by 1. Characters are usually limited to 5 + [Tier x2](Advancement.md).
- **Improve an Energy [Trait](Traits.md)**: Make an [Energy [Trait](Traits.md)](Energy[Trait](Traits.md)s.md) charge faster

### 8 Adjustment Points

If your campaign has [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), it costs 8 Adjustment points to gain an additional one, if it's available at all. All modifications to Special Abilities must be made with GM discussion and approval.

### 5 Adjustment Points

For 5 Adjustment Points, you can: 

- **Improve a [Trait](Traits.md) or Skill**: Increase the stack of an existing [Trait](Traits.md) or Skill by 1. [Traits](Traits.md) are usually capped at a stack of 5, Skills at a stack of [3 + Tier](Advancement.md).
- **Add a New [Trait](Traits.md)**: If it seems appropriate, you can add a new [Trait](Traits.md) with a stack of 1. New [Traits](Traits.md) should usually be gained after something happens in the story to trigger it.
- **Expand a Special Ability**: If you have a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md) with a list of sub-abilities, like Magic or Psychic Power, you can expand that power (gain new spells, for instance); doing so costs up to 5 Adjustment Points

### 2 Adjustment Points

For 2 Adjustment Points, you can:

- **Improve a Connection**: Increase the stack of a [Connection](Connections.md) by 1. After the game begins, there usually has to be an in-game justification for this improvement
- **Gain a New Connection**: Add a new [Connection](Connections.md)

### 1 Adjustment Point

For 1 Adjustment Point, you can:

- **Add a Detail**: You can add a new [Detail](Details.md) if it makes sense to do so.

You can also spend Adjustment Points to improve things like [Energy Pools](Energy.md), if you have such a thing. The cost depends on if it is a pool or a capacity, and what the pool is for. See [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) for more information.

## Holding Off

You don't have to spend all of your Adjustment Points as soon as you get them. Instead, you can hold some or all in reserve for later. You can do this to save up for a higher cost purchase, or to tweak your character in play.

### Tweaks

Adjustment Points can be spent at any time to make little changes to your character. You can even spend them in the middle of a session, if you like!

In session, you should justify the expenditure in some way, even if it's just an offhand comment ("Yeah, I've been studying Nambian history in my spare time"). Between sessions, you don't need to bother, but doing so might be worth a [Drama Die](DramaDice.md) to a generous GM.

### Bigger Purchases

THis one is pretty self explanatory. You can hold onto Adjustment Points until you have enough to make the change you want to make. For example, if you have only 2 points, but you want to increase your Wound Threshold, you can save them until you get 8 more.

## Character Creation: What's Next

At this stage in [Character Creation](CCSummary.md), you're more or less done. Finalize your [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold) and any [Energy Pools](Energy.md) you might have, then fill in any quirks or peccadillos that help round out your character, and get ready to play!
