# Aspects

Aspects represent central strengths of your character. Aspects aren't chosen from a list; they're player-defined and used to help describe the character as a person, and define their abilities. They can be used to reflect a character's heritage in games where there are options other than human, and can also be used as prerequisites for [Special Abilities](SpecialABilities.md).

Characters begin with two differentt Aspects with one rank each.Whatever Aspects you choose, they will be more effective if they're backed up with other [Characteristics](Characteristics.md). If you're Utterly Charming, you should probably have some social skills, and should think about your [Connections](Connections.md). If you're a Practiced Thief, you should probably have the Skills to back that up.

## Defining Aspects

Aspects should be short phrases that are easy to understand. Generally, it should be clear just by reading them what circumstances they should cover. They can imply groups of skills, a career, a general area of expertise, or a variety of other things. An aspect should be at least two words long, but can be a full sentence if they need to be. They should be broad, but not so broad as to apply to every - or even most - situations.

Aspects can look suspiciously like other Characteristics. Something like *Damn Strong* or *Has several Veteran Buddies* might look like [Traits](Traits.md) or [Connections](Connections.md) respectively, but that's okay. Aspects are souped-up versions of these things, allowing you to pull an extra Characteristic into a check, and can be used more broadly or with fewer limitations.

### Examples

- Olympic Gymnast
- Damn good starship pilot
- Veteran Private Detective
- Hard to Kill
- Never Gets Sick
- Ran away from the circus to go to school
- Jaw-droppingly attractive
- Inherited a fortune and a business empire
- Raised by Wolves in the jungles of India
- The last Princess of Everlight
- Driven by Revenge
- Fine Arts Major
- Elven Archer
- Strong Sense of Honor
- Always avenges an insult
- Has a mechanical heart forged by a Dwarven craftmaster

## Shifting Aspects

Sometimes things change over the course of a character's lifetime. People get older, or have their priorities shift. When this happens, it might make sense to *shift* an Aspect.

At any point in a character's career, if it makes sense, the GM can approve an Aspect Shift. If this happens, it changes to a different but thematically similar Aspect. Practiced Thief might become Security Consultant; Fine Arts Major might become Has an MFA in Poetry, making it even less useful; and so on.

Shifting an Aspect isn't the same as gaining a new Aspect, which requires spending [Advancements](Advancement.ms).
