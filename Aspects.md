# Aspects

**Selecting Aspects is Step 2 of [Character Creation](CCSummary.md)**

Aspects represent central strengths of your character. They function like souped-up [Traits](Traits.md) - they're pulled into rolls, and provide an extra success when you roll a 6.

When [burned](Burn.md), Aspects provide double successes just like Traits. That means that any even numbers count as two successes, and any 6 counts as 4.

Aspects aren't chosen from a list; they're player-defined and used to help describe the character as a person, and define their abilities. Like [Traits](Traits.md) and [Skills](Skills.md), Aspects can be stacked. All characters have at least two different Aspects.

## Defining Aspects

Aspects should be short phrases that are easy to understand. There really aren't any limits as to what they can be outside of those established in your [Parameters](Parameters.md), as long as they're not more than a few words long.

The word limitation exists for two reasons - to keep Aspects at-a-glance understandable, and to keep them from getting too specific. "Private Detective" is concise, paints a specific picture, and is easy to use.

To define your Aspects, think about things you want your character to be able to do that are central to their [Origin](Origin.md). They can be broad or specific, as long as they're descriptive.

### Examples

- Olympic Gymnast
- Circus Strongman
- Practiced Thief
- Veteran Private Detective
- Hard to Kill
- Never Gets Sick
- Utterly Charming
- So Very Hot
- Incredibly Rich
- Raised by Wolves
- Prince of Eddilshire
- Driven by Revenge
- Fine Arts Major

### Supporting Your Aspects

Whatever Aspects you choose, they don't exist in a vacuum. In order to make them more useful, you should build the rest of your character with your Aspects in mind.

If you're Utterly Charming, you should probably have some social skills, and should think about your [Connections](Connections.md) - perhaps using your Adjustment Points to get a few extra ones. If you're a Practiced Thief, you should probably have the Skills to back that up.

## Shifting Aspects

Sometimes things change over the course of a character's lifetime. People get older, or have their priorities shift. WHen this happens, it might make sense to "shift" an Aspect.

At any point in a character's career, if it makes sense, the GM can approve an Aspect Shift. If this happens, it changes to a different but thematically similar Aspect. Practiced Thief might become Security Consultant; Fine Arts Major might become Has an MFA in Poetry.

Aspect Shifts don't generally involve an [Advancement](Advancement.md) or [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md). Instead, the GM and the Player discuss the change, come to an agreement, and change the Aspect.

If the shifting Aspect is part of a stack, it usually all changes at once, but it might split into more than one Aspect with the stack divided between them.

## Character Creation: What's Next

The next step in Character Creation is to select up to 5 [Traits](Traits.md).
