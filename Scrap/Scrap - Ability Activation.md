# Ability Activation

Different abilities run off of different "energy" - that is to say, different resource pools, reserves, or other ways of gathering power. Some are no different from using a skill, while others must be built to, or are draining to use.

There are several different ways to go about this in the unnamed System. The options discussed in the tabs below cover a lot of ground but are not exhaustive.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Just Happens or Always On**

Some powers *just work*. For example, unless something weird is going on, Spider Man can lift a car, and knows when something bad is about to happen. He might need to make a check to react to his Spider-sense in time, or to determine what set it off - but he does notice when it goes off, and it is super reliable.

Abilities like this may be Features or even Powers. Using them effectively may require a Skill check of some kind, but using them is either automatic or once on, it just happens. Spider-Man's Spider-sense is an excellent example, actually: it *almost always* goes off when he's in danger, so he's never not aware of it, but occasionally, he zigs when he should zag, or just fails to dodge effectively. So the information is free and always works (Venom or other interfearance notwithstanding), but what he does might require a check,

Abilities like this don't require a check - you just get the information, or you can just lift the car, etc. How you use it, however, may require a check.

#### **Traits and Skills**

Often, the simpler or easier powers can just be things you add to what [Skills](Skills.md) and [Traits](Traits.md) can already do. This is especially useful for [Features](Features.md). You choose (or create) a skill that the ability is based on, and make a roll to use it. As usual, more successes is better. If you want the bonus a Focus provides, you need to take a Focus for the ability specifically. You can also choose the ability as your specialty.

**Example**:

> Bobbie has the Special Ability Spiritualist. Her player wants to be able to "consult the spirits" using her crystal ball as one of the abilities. The GM decides she can roll Occult in place of Academics as a Feature, and can also ask the spirits for more general information with an Occult check, treating the result as an Aid check for her next action.

This method can be combined with the methods listed in the other tabs. So, you can easily have a Momentum power that requires a skill check to use or to hit with, for example. This trigger can be added to an ability to help balance its use.

#### **Energy Pool**

You can call it whatever you want - Mana, Magic Points, Technique, Grit - you have a pool of points you spend to activate an ability. Generally, this pool is static, refilling when certain conditions are met - an hour's meditation, a night's sleep, prayer and supplication, or having a few too many beers - whatever it is, you do it, you get your Energy back.

To use an energy pool, you have to define its size (10 by default), what refills it, and what (if anything) besides using it can drain it. For example, maybe crossing over a line of salt drains some of your Mana pool.

When you use an Energy Pool powered ability, your pool is reduced by an amount equal to that ability's cost. So if you have a Mana of 10, and Fireball costs 2 points to cast, you have 8 Mana left.

Energy is a common choice for spellcasting and psychic powers.
