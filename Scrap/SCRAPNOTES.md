# SCRAP Notes

Update Character Sheet

Update CCSummarry (UML Chart)

Jesus Christ, dude, you don't have any craft skills.

## Skills System Overhaul

- Need to modify Burn.md CCSummary.md Characteristics.md to account for changes.
- Skills are now what Focuses were
- Focuses are what Specialties were

## Synergy.md

Allows the addition of extra stuff beyond the basic allowed - eg. someone with a Merchant skill and a Swordsmanship skill could claim Synergy for Merchant rolls when selling or buying a sword

## Conditions

Burned Out - can't use a Skill for a while

## Connections

Changed to Establish minimum 3, spend 10 Connection Points

## SAs

- Need those Fourth Edition style powers back
- Burn Skills/Specialties to activate Powers

## Point Buy

You need to consider it, at least for advancement

## Just Cool Stuff

Collector of Whispers

Phlogiston Blade

## Skill List

The skills listed below are (hopefully) comprehensive. The individual Focuses for the skills may shift between campaigns based on your established [Parameters](Parameters.md). The Focus lists are not intended to be comprehensive, either, merely to indicate the scope of foci.

There will probably eventually be a comprehensive list of foci for each skill; until then, use the ones listed below or make up something similar.
