# SCRAP Notes

Update Character Sheet

Update CCSummarry (UML Chart)

Jesus Christ, dude, you don't have any craft skills.

## Skills System Overhaul

- Need to modify Burn.md CCSummary.md Characteristics.md to account for changes.
- Skills are now what Focuses were
- Focuses are what SPecialties were

## Synergy.md

Allows the addition of extra stuff beyond the basic allowed - eg. someone with a Merchant skill and a Swordsmanship skill could claim Synergy for Merchant rolls when selling or buying a sword

## Burn.md

can add Traits etc. beyond the basic allowed (1 per characteristic type)

[Meta Traits](MetaTraits.md), [Details](Details.md), and [Complications](Complications.md) can also be pulled for a check, but follow their own rules for doing so; see the individual articles.

## Conditions

Burned Out - can't use a Skill for a while

## SAs

- Need those Fourth Edition style powers back
- Burn Skills/SPecialties to activate Powers

## Point Buy

You need to consider it, at least for advancement

## Just Cool Stuff
