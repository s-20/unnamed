# Scion Upgrade: Origin to Hero

Hero Upgrade Rules

1. Pick 2 more Callings (one of your 3 callings must come from your parent)
2. Spread 4 more dots between the 3 callings. Each calling must have 1 dot in it.
3. Get a heroic knack for each dot you have newly placed into a calling. You can choose to take an Immortal Knack but that counts as 2.
  - If your pre-Visitation Scion already knows more than five Knacks[Except for the ones you chose at the end of Origin Cgen] don't take any additional Knacks
4. All origin level knacks have an improved/Heroic version, upgrade all existing Origin Knacks to their heroic equivalent. If you do not have a Calling/Supernatural Origin Path(ex. Kitsune) associated with that Knack, you must either replace the Knack(or the calling) with one from either the Any List or from one of the three callings you have.
5. You receive the Pantheon-Specialty Purview associated with your Pantheon. You also get to pick one purview from your parent's list. These are both considered Innate to you and you get the Innate Power/Benefits of them and can perform marvels with those purviews without a Relic.
6. You have 7 dots to spend on Relics, Creatures, Followers, and Guides. Discuss with Storyteller.
    - Unless it is explicitly noted, Relics that grant Purviews do NOT grant the Purview's Innate Benefit.
7. Choose 2 Boons, they can be from any Purview that you have access to (Innately or through Guides/Relics).
8. Record your Legend (1)
9. Set your Virtue in the Middle and record your Pantheons Specific Virtues on either end of the Virtue Spectrum.
10. Re-Calculate Health and Defense
