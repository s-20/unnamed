# Ack_CPunk_2071

Custom Cyberpunk setting: 
>>
alternate Earth timeline, Divergence +/=/- 2000, current date 2071, further specific setting details to follow 
Low building to mid-high level action/mystery campaign with increasing stakes 

Players will take on the roles of members of a mercenary street crew tasked with a series of high-risk objectives. All are familiar with one another's work, but have never worked all together this way.

All standard C-punk archetypes will be available as long as their value to the mission can be explained (an entertainer could serve as a distraction, it's hard to be useless). Standard genre archetypes include

- **Street Samurai**: All the meat and all it wants. 
    - The street sam is the warrior. Their approach is as varied as war itself, from the bladed, faster than the eyes melee monster to the chrome behemoth in body armor and reinforced cyberarms carrying twin vulcan cannons, these are the slingers of lead, the heavies. 
- **Rigger**: A utility class to be sure, but no less combat capable than anyone but a 'Samurai, 
    - The rigger can safely deliver the team to the mission location, provide drone escort, and maintain security, all from the comfort of the Van, or other appropriate wifi equipped location 
- **Netrunner**: The console cowboy, the digital wizard. 
    - Anyone can plug in and dance in Cyberspace. It takes an artist to make cyberspace dance around you. Using a console and a special neural connection, the netrunner experiences the internet as a voluntary hallucination, a parallel universe where treasure chests might stand for money, and your programs and macros are lockpicks... A real world, beyond the real world, where your reflexes are the speed of your thought 
- **Political**: Council stooge or black suited Agent, politicals are there because that's the plan. 
    - Whatever is on the table you can bet that if she's on board, it serves her ends 
- **Corporate**: from lowly wage slave to vat grown assassin, corporates are there because the boss said so. 
    - Whatever is on the table, you can be sure that if the corporate is on board, someone stands to make money 
- **Entertainer**: the entertainer could be anyone, anywhere, for any reason. 
    - Social media content creators, actors, musicians, conceptual artists, performance artists, even the dreaded mime is an entertainer. There's value to be had in building cultural movements 
    
This list is not all inclusive. There's more to come regarding archetypes as I confirm system I am working to build a gear and cyber-tech supplement in M&M. Another Cyberpunk system drops Thursday and I will be reviewing it.

## Media

Genre relevant media resources and inspiration for flavor and research

- **Movies**
    - Blade Runner, Johnny Mnemonic, Strange Days, Ghost in the Shell, Alien, District 9, various "grim-near-future* sci-fi (alien is a bit of a reach on tech scale, but the feel of the world is right, dingy and lived in... The company... MU-TH-UR 6000...) 
- **Books**
    - William Gibson (author), specifically **The Sprawl Trilogy**: _Neuromancer_, _Count Zero_, and _Mona Lisa Overdrive_ 
    - Also informed by previous editions of Cyberpunk and Shadowrun as well as their novels 
- **Music**
    - Skrillex, Orbital, Beethoven, Aphex Twin, Paul Oakenfold, My Chemical Romance, Chopin, Lindsey Sterling, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, Greig, Flux Pavilion, Nero, Bassnectar, Tchaikovsky, Knife Party... 
    
    I could go on, but that's a solid background

As far as class mix I'd like to see a good balance for the party, overlapping combat coverage is never a bad thing, but all meat could pose a problem, as could all mind. I'd like to encourage everyone to play outside of type, but ultimately it's your character, and while it's my story I want you all to have fun helping me tell it.

### Erik

One last note: the story I want to tell will be in a fictional world I'm developing. I'll get world notes out as I get them organized in a way they make sense. For this reason, until I've had a chance to look at the new system, I'm not sure it will work for what I want or not. In the meantime I have a framework for M&M, and am still fleshing it out. If I end up going that route I will begin to have C-gen information available this weekend

### Devan

Is there a reason why the characters are only really familiar with each other via reputation or past jobs with one or the other and have never worked as a full group together? I would think having the ability to establish backgrounds as a crew that's worked together before might help create more robust backstory and character connections as a reason to have each other's backs as opposed to "I'm here for da money and I'll shoot you at the end for your cu

### Damion

Are you talking about a crew like baby driver? They have worked together before but they're not an established crew

### Erik

I had been thinking for story purposes. I assumed past association and the dynamic nature of your mutual experiences would bind you. I'm open to suggestion though if you think it would be better. I suppose the only important part is that you're not an established crew... No high profile jobs together, no managing agent, approached through independent channels

### Watts

Ugh. I wasted my hacker character on Scion! /jk. I'm looking at Rigger or a Social Media based Entertainer right now. Actually, a sorta combo of one of those and Street Samurai. I'm going to percolate ideas and keep you informed as I go. I'm making a file that compiles this thread with a few formatting changes for clarity. It's mostly for my benefit, but let me know if you want to see it, I can set up some kind of file share.
