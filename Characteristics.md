# Characteristics

Characteristics are the things that, collected together, define a character in mechanical terms, and also provide a lot of clues into the character's life and what sort of person (or whatever) they are. Characteristics are divided into types: [Aspects](Aspects.md), [Traits](Traits.md), [Skills](Skills.md), [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), [Connections](Connections.md), [Details](Details.md), [Tangles](Tangles.md), [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md), and a few different types of [Energy](Energy.md).

Generally, only one Characteristic of each type can be pulled into a check. For example, even if you have three different Traits that could be used for a particular check, you can only pull one of them.

The Characteristics are:

- [Aspects](Aspects.md) represent things that make you special or a big deal, broad areas of expertise, major talents, or some other *big deal* aspect of our character. Aspects are analogous to things like Class in other games, along with things like extreme wealth, exceptional talent, or other major character abilities. 
- [Traits](Traits.md) are broad areas of talent of training, representing core abilities of a character: things like if they're especially Strong or Charismatic or Clever.
- [Skills](Skills.md) are things a character knows about or how to do. Skills are fairly broad, representing a significant area of expertise; more specific things are represented by sub-skills called Focuses.
- [Connections](Connections.md) are things that tie your character to the world around them. Connections can be organizations you belong to, people you can count on, events you were present for, or places you are especially comfortable with or tied to.
- [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md) represents how much punishment you can take and how good you are at directly resisting harm. All characters start with the same number of ranks in this Characteristic (by default 3), but each character may have different resistances or notes that make their ability to avoid harm unique,
- [Tangles](Tangles.md) are problem areas for the character, representing disabilities, social problems, fears or other psychological troubles, enemies, and so on. Tangles can make your life more difficult, but they help replenish [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) and can be used for other things as well.
- [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) are superhuman or supernatural abilities a character has access to. Things like superpowers, magic, psychic ability, and ultra-tech all qualify. Special Abilities are highly specific to individual characters, although a given setting may have established tropes you need to follow. Not all games have Special Abilities, but in any game that has them, all characters have the same access to them.
- [Energy](Energy.md) Traits are pools the character can draw from to power Special Abilities or to otherwise bolster their character.
- [Details](Details.md) are little quirks, affectations, or special notes that make a character truly unique. These are minor things that can, in edge cases, provide you a little boost, but are mostly here for flavor.
- [Stuff](Stuff.md) isn't exactly a characteristic. Instead, it's a list of things you have, a description of personal wealth, and other assets or possesions.

Although some Characteristics may not be used in some games, all characters usually have **Aspects**, **Traits**, **Skills**, **Connections**, and **Wound Threshold**.
