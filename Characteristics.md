# Characteristics

Characteristics are the things that, collected together, define a character in mechanical terms, and also provide a lot of clues into the character's life and what sort of person (or whatever) they are. Characteristics are divided into types: [Aspects](Aspects.md), [Traits](Traits.md), [Skills](Skills.md), [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), [Connections](Connections.md), [Details](Details.md), and [Tangles](Tangles.md), [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md), and a few different types of [Energy](Energy.md).

Each Characteristic type has its own article, and is described in brief here. Generally, only one Characteristic of each type can be pulled into a check, so even if you have three different Traits that could be used for a particular check, you can only pull one of them.
