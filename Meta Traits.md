# Meta Traits

Sometimes characters have a certain something that's difficult to define in terms of direct description. Perhaps they're lucky, or doing things the dangerous way always pays off for them. These characters have Meta Traits.

Meta Traits are selected for a character like any other [Trait](Traits.md) during [Character Creation](CCSummary.md) or [Improvement](Advancement.md), but they work in more specific ways. They might be less reliable, or have diminishing returns, or have a chance of backfiring, or some other restriction.

There are four Meta Traits: Lucky, Daredevil, Genre Savvy, and Dilettante. The rules for each are described in detail below.

## Lucky

Some people are occasionally just lucky. They get through things not due to skill or natural ability, but because the winds of fate are at their backs. Of course, relying on luck can also backfire impressively.

In order to use the Luck Trait, you have to [Burn](Burn.md) it, and quirks rolled on the Lucky dice are doubled. If your luck dice wind up rolling more quirks than successes, your luck turns against you. You fail at what you're trying to do and something disastrous happens. Describe what happens to you, and if it's your Turn in [Combat](Combat.md), your turn is over.

## Daredevil

It happens all the time in the movies - that crazy character that runs charging into a hail of bullets, but comes out unscathed. A great example of this is Wyatt Erp in the movie Tombstone - in one scene, he walks out into a lake, completely surrounded, and guns down all his attackers without taking a single hit.

The Daredevil trait can be pulled on any check where you deliberately put yourself into danger; if you're playing it safe in any way, like using cover, or there being a net below the tightrope, or you're wearing armor, you can't use the trait. If you roll more quirks than successes on your daredevil dice, you take a [Wound](WoundThreshold.md) or gain a [Condition](Conditions.md).

## Genre Savvy

To quote [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy):

!> A Genre Savvy character doesn't necessarily know they're in a story, but they do know of stories like their own and what worked in them and what didn't. They may attempt to apply the lessons they've learned from movies, books, or other fiction to their own situation, or they may restrict themselves to snarky asides and observations.

Whenever being keenly aware of genre of game you're in would help, or when you're acting on genre awareness, you can burn Genre Savvy to add it to the check. You can also Burn Genre Savvy to get a tip from the other players or the GM as to what a genre-appropriate response to the situation might be.

## Dilettante

You've picked up a lot of small, oddly specific skills and abilities over the course of your life. You can burn Dilettante to use it like having a Skill, Focus, and Specialty for one check. At some point in your past, you studied or encountered something perfect for *this precise thing* and *only this situation*. 

Have fun describing how you came across such a specific ability, but the planets will never align this way again, and you can't use this Trait twice for the same thing. Something, however small, is different next time, and makes your knowledge on the topic useless.
