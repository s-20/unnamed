# Credits

This page contains general thank-yous for those who support the game's development, and a place to provide credit for assets used in the game.

## Editors

I'd like to thank the following people for helping with copy editing, style checking, and otherwise helping my sometimes florid and obscure text become usable. I will add names as I get consent to print them:

- My wife, Joy, has provided feedback along the way, mostly helping me make things more readable and clear

## Play testers

Thank you all so much! I really appreciate the tie you've shared with me. It has made all the difference.

Play testers can provide feedback in two ways:

- Join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/tEEMfNW) — this is the best place to ask questions and provide general feedback
- Create an Issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/s-20/unnamed) — this is the best way to provide feedback about unclear rules, bad links in the wiki, and so on

If you'd like, I'm happy to list any play testers here. Please let me know how you want to be credited in the Discord channel. I respect your privacy, however, and will only list you on request. I'm happy to post links to your Social Media provided it's not Facebook or its subsidiaries (I won't link to Facebook, sorry), if that's what you're into.

## Art

There's not much art on this website. Any Art that does appear is either used with the express permission of its creator, is under some form of open license, or is in the public domain. I'm happy to include any art that is donated to the wiki.

I have specifically used images from [unDraw](https://undraw.co/), a website that provides open source icons and images for use on the web.
