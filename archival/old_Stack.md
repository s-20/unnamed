# Stack

When a characteristic is particularly strong or influential, you may have more than one in it's Stack. That is, when you pull it for a dice roll or it is otherwise factored into play or a check, it counts equal to its stack, rather than at 1.

As a simple example, say you want your character to be not just Strong, but Very Strong. When making your character, you put three ranks into the Strong [Trait](Traits.md), giving them a Stack of 3.

## Benefits of a Stack

When pulling a characteristic with a Stack above 1, you pull that many dice into the roll. So to continue the example above, whenever the character needed to lift a heavy weight, or perhaps when they punched someone, and they pulled their Strong trait into the check, they would gain 3 dice for the check.

Stacking also comes in handy when you [Burn](Burn.md) a characteristic. Each time you burn a characteristic, it is temporarily lowered by 1. Having a higher Stack means you can burn the characteristic more often, although this can be dangerous (especially in the case of [Personal Connections](Connections.md)).

## Zero Stack

If you don't have any ranks in a characteristic, you have Zero Stack in it. For most characteristics, this just means that you can't use it to generate successes, and you can't burn it. [Skills](Skills.md) may operate differently, however.

If you have Zero Stack in a [skill](Skills.md), depending on circumstances, the skill in question, the tools at hand, and even your other skills, you may be able to default a check. If you have to pull a Zero Stack skill into a check, you only gain dice from other characteristics, and on all the dice you gain half a success if you roll a 6, and no successes otherwise. You need at least one full success to succeed.

## Null Stack

A Null Stack means that you can't use the ability *at all*. If you have a Null Stack of Strong, then you cannot exert physical force on the world. This means more than failing any check involving strength - it means you are essentially paralyzed, or nearly so. You roll all physical checks as outlined in Zero Stack, above, whether they would involve the Strong [Trait](Traits.md) or not.

A Zero Stack in a [Skill](Skills.md) means not only do you not have that skill, you are also incapable of having it, rolling a default for it, or ever learning it.

Null Stacks qualify as [Complications](Complications.md), but PCs should try to avoid them unless they have a good in-character reason for taking them.
