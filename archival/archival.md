# Archival

This folder is used to house old or out of date articles that I want to keep around for reference of historical reasons. In other words, this folder contains all the stuff that's been completely re-worked, or has been eliminated completely from the system, but that I thought was interesting enough to keep around. None of this stuff is part of the game anymore.
