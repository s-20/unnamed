# Old Wound Threshold (backup)

A character's Wound Threshold represents how much physical punishment they can take. Basically, when you have Wounds equal to your Wound Threshold, you're dying.

The default starting value for Wound Threshold is 5, but it can vary quite a bit depending on the [Parameters](Parameters.md) of the game. The setting, genre, and tone can all impact starting Wound Thresholds.

Character [Origins](Origin.md) may impact Wound Threshold as well - a Dwarf can probably take more punishment than a Halfling, for example.

Damage you take in the Unnamed System comes in the form of Wounds, which are a special sort of [Condition](Conditions.md). As your wounds pile up, things get worse and worse for you.

## Reeling

Any time you receive more than one wound in a round, or whenever your total number of Wounds is more than half your Wound Threshold, you're reeling, and you gain the Reeling [Condition](Conditions.md), and all your dice pools are reduced by 1.

If you're reeling from taking more than one Wound in a round, it lasts until the end of your next turn. If you're reeling because your Wound total is more than half your Wound Threshold, you stay reeling until your wound count is reduced.

## Dying

When a character takes Massive Damage, or their Wounds are equal to their Wound Threshold, they gain 1 stack of Dying. Any further wounds add 1 to the stack.

Each round, at the end of your turn, you must make a Death Check by rolling dice equal to your Dying stack. If you roll all Successes, you've stabilized, and your Dying Condition ends; you're unconscious and probably in need of medical attention.

If you don't roll all successes, your condition worsens, and your Dying stack increases by 1. If you roll a Quirk, it increases by 2 (multiple quirks do not have additional effects), or something complicates the situation. If your dying stack reaches 5, you die; see [Death](Death.md).

## Option: Bruised

If you want a less lethal game, you can add a Bruised Pool with 5 or 10 levels on it. When a character takes a wound, they can spend from their Bruised pool to negate the wound. If a single source causes more than one wound, only one can be countered with the Bruised Pool.

Losing points from the Bruised pool doesn't cause ill effects, but may be used as a trigger for [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md). Once your Bruised pool is empty, you can no longer negate wounds with it, and all further damage adds to your Wound Stack.

Some effects or events in game may bypass the bruised pool. For instance falling in a vat of acid may cause damage directly to wounds. This should generally be avoided, however, allowing the player to spend Bruised to negate some or all of the damage with good description (I grab the edge of the vat at the last second!).

Bruised is an example of a Special Ability with a [Energy Pool](Energy.md). See [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) for more information about how these things are put together.
