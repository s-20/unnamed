# Improvement

During an extended campaign, characters may grow and increase in ability. This is handled through Improvements and [Awards](Award.md). This article discusses how Improvements work, how they are given out to the characters, and what they can be used for.

## Gaining Improvements

In campaigns that include them, Improvements are dished out at a rate that the GM finds to be comfortable for the story. Handing them out too fast - or too formulaically - can result in early power creep, while handing them out too slowly can be unsatisfying for the players.

The following guidelines are, therefore, a *suggestion*. Customize the awards to better fit your campaign and playstyle. For example, if you play particularly long sessions, but only occasionally, you may want to increase the rate of Improvement. Any rate of Improvement should be discussed when establishing [Parameters](Parameters.md) during Session Zero.

### Suggested Improvement Rate

- One Improvement per session
- One Improvement for completing a major personal goal
- One Improvement for completing a major co-operative goal
- Two Improvements for completing a major Story Arc

## Using Improvements

Improvements are primarily used to - you guessed it - *Improve* a character, but that is not their only use. Improvements can also be used to buy [Perks](Perks.md) or restore [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) at the start of a game session.

### Advancing a Character

The primary use for Improvements is to advance a character, improving their [Characteristics](Characteristic.md), or expanding a character's abilities.

Different Advancements have different Improvement costs:

- 1 Improvement
  - Gain a [Detail](Details.md)
  - Restore a damaged [Connection](Connections.md) by 1
- 3 Improvements
  - Gain 1 [stack](Stack.md) in a new [Trait](Traits.md) or [Skill](Skills.md)
  - Gain a [Focus](Foci.md) for a Skill with a [stack](Stack.md) of 3 or higher
- 5 Improvements
  - Increase the Stack of a [Trait](Traits.md) or [Skill](Skills.md) with a total below 5 by 1
  - Gain a [Focus](Foci.md) regardless of the [stack](Stack.md) (or existence) of a related Skill.
  - Add a third Aspect during Character Creation
- 10 Improvements
  - Gain an additional Aspect
- Variable Cost
  - Improve a [Trait](Traits.md) or [Skill](Skills.md) beyond a [stack](Stack.md) of 5: a number of improvements equal to the new [stack](Stack.md) size (so to improve from 6 to 7 would cost 7 Improvements)

If your character has an [Energy](Energy.md) Pool or Resource of some kind, you may also be able to improve it directly. This depends on the [Knack](Knacks.md) in question and how they're being handled in a campaign, and should be tailored to the ability.

### Buying Perks and Drama Dice

You can also expend Improvements to gain [Perks](Perks.md), reflecting a reliance on Luck rather than improving your skill. This will only carry you so far, of course.

At the start of a session you may trade 1 Improvement to increase your Perk total to 5. If your Perk total is already five, you cannot spend Improvements to gain additional Perks, but you *can* add 2 [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) to the pool for 1 additional Improvement.
