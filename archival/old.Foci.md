# Foci

Foci are highly specialized versions of [Skills](Skills.md). Although you can take them as standalone [Characteristics](Characteristic.md), they are most commonly gained as a bonus for having a [Stack](Stack.md) of 3 or more in a single [Skill](Skills.md).

## Using Foci

A Focus is pulled into a check like any other [Characteristic](Characteristic.md). Pulling a Focus doesn't add dice to the check. Instead, if you roll at least one Success, you gain an additional Success on the check, and if you don't roll at least one success, add a die to the [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) pool.

## Gaining Foci

You can gain a Focus in three ways: as a Bonus for improving a Skill to a [Stack](Stack.md) of 3 or more, as an [Award](Awards.md) for role playing, or through an [Improvement](Improvement.md).

### Bonus Foci

If you increase a [Skill](Skills.md)'s Stack to 3, you gain a free Focus for that Skill. This happens automatically regardless of when the Skill's stack improves - during character creation, as an in-game [Award](Award.md), or through [Improvement](Improvement.md).

Bonus Foci must be a directly related subset of the skill that gave you the bonus. For example, if you reach a Stack of 3 with the Close Combat skill, then Longsword is an acceptable focus, but Crossbow is not.

### Award and Improvement Foci

A GM may wish to award a Focus as an [Award](Award.md) if a character consistantly does well at a particular thing over the course of several sessions. The implication here is that regardless of intentional training, the character has a particular talent in that area.

For example, if a character who has never shot a revolver before grabs one off a corpse and then consistantly hits when attacking with it for a few sessions, the GM might give them Focus: Revolver as an Award.

Foci gained in this manner do not have to reflect a particular skill, although they are usually associated with one. In the example above, the character that gained the Focus might not even have a single rank stacked into Distant Combat; they could still gain and use the Focus.

Improvement Foci are similar. A character may use an Improvement to gain a Focus. The focus should be based on the character's [Origin](Origin.md), or based on things that happened in the game, but the character doesn't need a particular stack in a Skill to justify it.
