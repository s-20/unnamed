# unnamed System Core Rules

The unnamed System has a lot of moving parts, but everything builds off of a fairly simple set of rules. There are two primary conceits at work in the system: Resolution (representing how challenges are resolved and what the moving parts are) and Principles (the design precepts behind the Resolution, and *how* the moving parts move).

## Core Mechanics

unnamed uses dice pools composed of d6s to determine success and failure. Dice come in a few [types](DiceTypes.md), but most of the time, you will be counting successes on a result of 6.

If your character is particularly good at something, they might roll Talented instead, because the task is relatively easy for them. With a Talented roll, count a success on a 5 or higher.

If you gather more than 5 dice into a check, you go into [Overkill](Overkill.md) rules.

### Difficulty and Failing Forward

The difficulty of a task is defined by the number of successes needed for the task to be accomplished the way you want it to be done. This ranges from 1 (easy tasks) to 5 (very hard).

An *Ongoing Task* or a *Teamwork Task* handle difficulty slightly differently, and have special rules, but successes are counted in the same way; see [Special Tasks](SpecialTasks.md).

Just because you didn't get the difficulty doesn't mean you failed, however. Most of the time, you will "fail forward" instead: you accomplish your goal, but with some sort of caveat or twist. Your task may take longer, or your workmanship may be shoddy, or you might get hurt in the process - anything is possible, and it will seldom be in your favor. If nothing else, you may succeed, but take a [Mark](Marks.md) going forward.

You can only really *fail* if two criteria are met:

1. You rolled no successes and had 4 or fewer dice in your pool
2. Failing won't bring the story to a standstill



### Creating a Pool

To figure out how many dice you should roll for a given check, you "pull" different [Characteristics](Characteristic.md). Most Characteristics have a [Stack](Stack.md); you get **normal** dice for the check equal to the stack of the characteristic. If the characteristic doesn't have a stack, you may get one ***hard*** die, depending on the situation.

Which Statistics you can pull for the roll is generally up to you, although the GM may request specific Characteristics depending on the roll, and circumstances often dictate or limit your choices.

You are limited in how many of each Characteristic you can pull. You can usually only use 1 [Aspect](Aspects.md), 1 [Trait](Traits.md), 1 [Skill](Skills.md), and 1 [Connection](Connections.md). Other characteristics may be added to or modify pools as well; see [Meta Traits](MetaTraits.md), [Details](Details.md), and [Complications](Complications.md).

You can improve your chances of success and even pull additional Characteristics by *burning* them, see [Burn](Burn.md).

## Principles

unnamed has a few important operating assumptions, or *Principles*, of both design and use. These are as important as the actual mechanics of the game. Not only do they color how the rules are used, they had a direct impact on how the rules were designed.

When paying an unnamed game, the following 6 Principles are important:

1. **unnamed is *co-operative*, not *adversarial***
   - This isn't a GM vs. Players style RPG. Not that there's anything wrong with that style of play, it's just not how unnamed is designed.
   - Even Player versus Player can get a bit dicey because of *Principle 4* (see below).
2. **Players should have narrative power**
   - In a shared narrative experience, giving players more narrative control can make the story feel more about their characters; this is, in the eyes of unnamed, a good thing.
   - This has the added benefit of making the GM's job a bit easier by distributing the creative burden a little more evenly.
3. **Balance isn't *just* the System's job**
   - Sure, a system needs to be balanced, but (especially in a universal system) perfect balance in a system is impossible. unnamed operates on the assumption that the group will work together to maintain a level of balance that makes their game enjoyable, whatever that means to the individual group.
   - This leads directly into -
4. **Narrative Balance is more important than Mechanical Balance**
   - In the Marvel universe, there is a group of heroes called The Avengers. This group contains both Thor and Hawkeye. Thor is the literal god of thunder. Hawkeye is pretty good with a bow. They are not, in any way shape or form, mechanically balanced, but they are both important to the narrative.
   - It's more important that everyone has a chance to shine and pay the character they want to play than it is for all characters to be "balanced" or "equal".
   - unnamed operates on the assumption that everyone is together to share a narrative experience, not outdo one another or break the system.
   - Build the character you want, and then figure out how your normal-human-super-spy and the infinitely strong green ogre can contribute to the same battle.
5. **You should be able to play what you want, not what the system lets you**
   - A lot of the systems in unnamed are intentionally left open-ended. The [Special Ability rules](SpecialAbilities.md) are an excellent example. This is intended as a *feature*, not a *flaw*.
   - While there are a lot of rules here, they're all meant to be flexible, hackable, and easily modified, while also being broad enough for you to tell the stories you want to tell.
6. **Complex does not mean Deep, and vice-versa**

## What To Read Next

You've got a couple directions to go from here.

- **[Parameters](Parameters.md)**: What the players and GM want to achieve with the game and establishing boundaries
- **[Character Creation Summary](CCSummary.md)**: Step-by-step instructions on how to make a character, with references to appropriate pages.
- **[Unnamed Index](UnnamedIndex.md)**: a list of all major articles in the Wiki, with brief descriptions for each

There's also a *Work In Progress* Character Sheet available; it's just a Markdown file with headings in place for all Characteristics and a few notes about what things mean for now, but it may be helpful; you can download it **[HERE](https://s-20.github.io/unnamed/Playtest1/PlaytestCharacterSheet.md)**.
