# Awards

Awards are a special form of advancement that GMs hand out to characters due to exceptional roleplay, or other cool events in the game. Most Awards are increases to [Connections](Connections.md) stacks or bonus [Foci](Foci.md), but can take any form.

## Connection Awards

Connection awards are the most common sort of awards, and are dished out whenever appropriate. If a character does something to strengthen a connection, the GM can increase the stack for that Connection by 1.

Connection Awards don't really have any limitations, except that they must make sense in context. A whole group present at an event could gain one or more in a [Stack](Stack.md) for that event as a connection. Someone doing a big favor for a personal connection could gain in that stack as well.

Connection Awards are fast and loose because Connections cannot usually be improved through the use of [Improvements](Improvement.md). Moreover, some Connections can be damaged, making Connection Awards a way of restoring them.

## Focus Awards

Sometimes a character can prove that they're good a a very particular thing just by doing it well multiple times. If a character does basically the same thing three or more times and gets three or more successes each time, it may be appropriate to give them a Focus Award.

A Focus Award is identical to any other Focus.
