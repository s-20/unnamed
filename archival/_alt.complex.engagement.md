An **Action** is a thing you do, usually during your turn. Actions involve stating what you're trying to do, making any needed Checks, and then describing the actual results based on those checks or other circumstances. You get two Actions on your turn, and can take Reactions when it's not your turn.

Actions are divided into four different categories:

- **Maneuvers** are any actions that move you around the battlefield, or otherwise help you position yourself tactically. A Maneuver can mean running to a place, closing with an opponent, taking cover, or using indirect fire to provide cover.
- **Attacks** are attempts to apply adverse effects or inflict harm on an opponent. Attacks aren't necessarily directly hitting things, although that is certainly the most common sort of thing. Attacks include striking someone with a weapon, casting an offensive spell on someone, or breaking through a barrier.
- **Defenses** are active attempts to avoid harm, or using abilities to bolster yourself or an ally. Defenses include going into a Defensive stance, Waiting for an Opening, or using First Aid on an ally. Some Defenses can also be used as a Reaction.
- **Concentration** is a catch-all for other things you need to do in a fight, from focusing magical energies to disarming a bomb to taking careful aim. If it doesn't fit into one of the above categories, then it's Concentration.

You can usually only perform a given category of Action once in a round without penalty. For instance, you could use an Attack and a Maneuver normally, but if you wanted to use two Attacks, you would be down 1 die on both of them. There are two exceptions - you can take two Defenses without penalty, and some Concentration actions might require using both of your available actions.

Each category has a few default actions that are available to (almost) all characters. Different characters with [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) or other advantages might change how these default actions work, or might provide additional available actions. In addition, if you want to do something that doesn't sound like any of these default actions, you're welcome to do so - just pitch the action to the GM, and determined what Category it belongs in and what required checks there are.

### Maneuvers

Maneuvers are things that get you around the battlefield or otherwise involve tactical movement. You can move 6 Squares (12 meters/yards, or 1 Range Band) as a single action without leaving yourself open. You can take a second Maneuver in the same round, but if you do, you leave yourself Open.

Maneuvers can be used for things other than just movement. You can use a Maneuver to: 

- **Take Cover**, which increases the [Effort](Effort.md) required to hit you by 1 or, depending on the cover taken, may make you impossible to target. You can move 2 Squares (6 meters/yards) while Taking Cover.
- **Move with Stealth**, moving quietly and keeping to shadows or cover. You can move 2 Squares (6 meters/yards) without a penalty to your Stealth Check dice pool. Each square of movement beyond that causes a cumulative 1 die penalty to your dice pool, up to a maximum of 5 Squares for a single action. You can't effectively Move with Stealth more than 5 Squares in a round.
- **Hide** is like taking cover, except the goal is to be out of site or somewhere you will go unnoticed. You can move up to 3 squares before hiding, but you take a 1 die penalty to your check for each square after the first. Whoever you're hiding from can't be looking right at you - if they're in Close range of you, you probably can't hide unless they're in a melee with another character.
- **Sprint**, which uses up all your Actions and Reactions for the round. You move 15 Squares (30 meters/yards), or up to 20 Squares (40 meters/yards) if it's in a straight line. You leave yourself Open in doing so, and as noted lose your Reactions for the round, but you can take a free Take Cover at the end of the movement.
- **Crawl** If you're on the ground, or drop to the ground, you can crawl up to 3 Squares as a single action. While you're crawling, any attacks from Near or further away require 1 more Effort to hit you, but attacks from Close gain a bonus die to hit.

Things like dropping prone or standing up don't count as Actions, and can be done for free.

### Attacks

Attacks are actions taken against an opponent with the intent of causing some sort of harm - either wounding them or otherwise causing them trouble. Almost anything you do offensively will count as an Attack. If you want to make more than one attack in a round, your dice pool for both attacks is reduced by 1.

The basic Attack Maneuvers are:

- **Basic Attack** is used to hit someone with a weapon or your bare hands. Generally speaking, you need at least 1 Effort to hit (causing a [Conditions](Conditions.md) or loss of [Characteristics](Characteristics.md), and 2 Effort to inflict a [Wound](WoundThreshold.md).  Additional Effort can be applied to special effects. The Range for your attack depends on the weapon you're using (see Range Zones, below). Active Defenses may allow your opponent to negate some of your Effort, but if you roll at least 1 Effort, you're guaranteed to do at least that much under most circumstances. You can move 1 Square as part of a Basic Attack.
- **Defensive Attack** allows you to take 2 dice from your Basic Attack dice pool to gain [Synergy](Synergy.md) for your Defense Maneuvers and Defensive Reactions until the start of your next turn. you take until next round. It otherwise functions as a Basic Attack.
- **Power Attack** sacrifices skill for raw force, and can generally only be done with muscle-powered attacks (the check must pull the Strong [Trait](Traits.md)). You take dice, two at a time, out of your dice pool for the check to attack. If you roll at least 1 Effort on the check, you get +1 Effort for every 2 dice removed this way. You can move up to 1 Square as part of a Power Attack.
- **Desperate Attack** uses all your Actions and Reactions for the round. You can make either one attack with 2 [Synergy](Synergy.md), or you can make three attacks at -1 die to each attack. Either way, you cannot move and your turn ends immediately.

### Defenses

Defense Actions are things you do to bolster or protect yourself from incoming attacks. You can take two Defenses on your turn without penalty.

The basic Defenses are:

- **Evasive Action** allows you to prepare a Defensive Pool to apply as a Reaction to incoming attacks, dodging around the battlefield. You pull a check together (usually involving some sort of combat related skill and agility themed traits). Each Effort you roll is put into a pool that can be used to negate successes from attacks targeting you. You can reduce the incoming Effort of the attack to 0 this way (meaning it misses).
- **Defensive Stance** - you assume a defensive posture, with your guard up and ready to block, dodge, or parry. The Effort required to hit you goes up by 1, and you gain Synergy for any Defensive Reactions you make until the start of your next turn. If someone attacks and misses you at Close range, you can move up to 1 Square and make a Basic Attack as a Reaction against your opponent, but if you do so you lose the benefits of this stance.
- **Shield Another** you grant allies in Close range Synergy on their Defense Actions and Defensive Reactions until the start of your next turn. Whenever an ally in Close range is attacked, you can move adjacent to them as a Reaction.
- **Covering FIre** you provide covering fire for an ally while they move. This makes it so they can take two Maneuvers (or take the Sprint Maneuver) in the round without leaving themselves open. If you use a fully automatic weapon to provide covering fire, your ally gains Synergy on any Defensive Reactions they make until the start of your next turn.

### Concentration

Concentration is a catch-all term for any action that isn't covered by Maneuver,  Attack, or Defense. It includes doing non-combat things in combat (like picking a lock or searching for something), or taking extra time to use a Special Ability (like casting a spell), or taking extra time to make sure you hit (aiming). Basically, if you do it during an Engagement, but it doesn't involve moving, harming, or preventing harm, it's probably a Concentration action.

Basic Concentration Actions include:

- **Aim** uses an Action to make it more likely that you will hit with an attack. If you Aim, you gain 2 Synergy on your next Basic Attack, Defensive Attack, or Power Attack; you can't aim a Desperate Attack.
- **Search** allows you to spend time looking for something. It can be used to spot signs of an invisible or hidden opponent, or to check the floor for traps, or to look for a weakness in a structure. Make a search-related Check. The results may provide Synergy for your next Action, provide additional information, or anything else.
- **(Skill) Action** involves using a non-combat skill during an engagement. Combat is dangerous and distracting, so you're always down at least 1 die on any non-combat [Skill](Skills.md) checks unless they're part of another Concentration action listed here, or there are other special circumstances.
- **Attend** allows you to forcus your attention on a specific task; it can be used like Aim, except for non-Attack actions, and provides Synergy for your next action. It might also be required to perform another action - Attend is what you use for any task longer than a single action. This might mean the extra concentration required for a psychic power, to maintain a spell, or anything else. 

### Reactions

Reactions are things you can do when it's not your turn in response to what others are doing. You can always **Prepare a Reaction** on your turn, taking any Action other than a Desperate Attack or a Sprint and saying "As soon as {Thing Happens}, I will {Chosen Action}".

In addition, anyone can take the following Reactions. Your dice pools for these reactions start at -1, and go down by 1 for each previous Reaction you've taken in the round:

- **Dodge, Parry, or Block** you get out of the way of an incoming attack. knock an attack away with a weapon, or get something in between you and an attack (like a shield). Make a check, and cancel 1 Effort from the incoming attack for every 2 Effort you roll. If you negate at least 1 Effort, you can move 1 Square.
- **Dive for Cover** lets you get out of the way of an area effect, reducing the damage or effect. You move 1 Square, and make a check as though your had Dodged. If the movement would put you behind cover, get 1 Synergy on the check. If you get at least 2 Effort, then the effective Effort of the attack is reduced to 1. You're prone until the start of your next turn, and can't take other reactions.
- **Riposte** if someone misses you at Close range, you can make a Basic Attack against them with a -2 die penalty as a Reaction.

NPCs can Prepare a Reaction, but they can't use the other reactions listed here. As a general rule, NPCs should only do things on their turn. This helps keep things moving.

### Leaving Yourself Open

You may have noticed that several things can leave you Open. Being Open can trigger a Prepared Reaction, and can also key into Special Abilities or other special combat actions. For example, a seasoned warrior might have a special Action that allows them to make a Basic Attack for free if an opponent in Close Range leaves themselves Open.

In addition, being Open makes it more difficult to defend yourself. If you're Open, you take a -1 die penalty on all Defense Actions and Defensive Reactions.
