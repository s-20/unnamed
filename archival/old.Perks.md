# Perks

Perks are special rewards gained for good role playing, primarily from facing your [Tangles](Tangles.md) or making sacrifices for your group. Perks are a powerful meta-tool that you can use to affect the story in your character's favor.

## Using Perks

Perks can be put to a variety of uses. From making re-rolls to fueling [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), perks have many uses.

The simplest use of Perks is to provide a re-roll to a Check - if you don't like the results of a check, you can spend a Perk to re-roll it. You can then take whichever result you prefer. You can only use perks this way on your own rolls, unless you have a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md) that allows you to use it on others.

Other uses for perks include:

- **Altering the Scene** - make a change to the scene that gives you an advantage
- **As Energy** - Perks can be used to cover [Energy](Energy.md) costs for [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md)
- **Trading for Drama Dice** - Perks can be converted to [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md)

[Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) can add additional perk effects to a character, and the Group can always agree on other things as well.

### Altering the Scene

Perks can be used in a manner similar to [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) to alter a scene, except that the alteration must be specific to your character in some way. You happen to have an extra magazine for your gun, the Guard shares one of your Connections, or you find the right key on the ring first try.

You can also alter the scene to avoid dealing with one of your Complications without specifically ignoring it - for example, say a character with alcohol use disorder comes across a study that has a nice crystal decanter full of what looks like scotch. The player spends a Perk, and goes in for a drink - only to discover that it's iced tea.

### Perks and Special Abilities

Perks can be used as emergency [Energy](Energy.md) for Exploits or other parts of a [Special Ability](SpecialAbilities.md). The way this works depends on the type of energy pool you have. A Perk can activate any single exploit based on a spendable or charging pool, can add 1 Momentum to your total, or can push you to a Breaking Point. Other energy resources can be affected in a similar way.

Perks can also be granted additional uses through Special Abilities. FOr example, a character might have a Good Luck Charm ability that lets them spend Perks to allow others to re-roll, or a Jinx charm that allows them to force opponents to re-roll.

### Trading for Drama Dice

At the end of a session, you can trade in one or more perk for [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md). You can trade as many as you like, up to the campaign's maximum Drama Dice pool.

Drama Dice are available to everyone, and perks are only available to you, so trading in Perks this way can help out the group.
