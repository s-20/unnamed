# Dumb Side Projects

I get sidetracked easily. I don't have [ADD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder) or anything like that, but sometimes I get distracted by a thought, and then an hour later I'm a mile down the rabbit hole chasing Alice across the chessboard (literary mixed metaphors, FTW).

I like game mechanics. I'm fascinated by resolution systems, character creation systems, and combat mechanics, among other things. I like seeing how people handle [stuff you know how to do](Skills.md) verses [general talent](Traits.md) verses [the stuff you're just plain made to do](Aspects.md). I also like seeing how the rules bend themselves into [little pretzels](MetaTraits.md) for [fun stuff](SpecialAbilities.md) that makes each character unique.

I also love creative settings and game setups. It’s always cool seeing how people use system to reinforce types of play, and to bolster setting. Now, I'm personally of the opinion that if your rules reinforce the type of play you're after, then all you need for them to reinforce your setting is a coat of paint. Change some names around or something - like the Storypath system ~~does~~ tries to do.

Where was I? Right - rabbit holes. Anyway, sometimes these trips to Wonderland are interesting enough that I want to pursue them a bit. That can mean delving into some mechanics, or marrying some piece of a game to some narrative goal, or ideas that might fit into a different game, or a variety of other things.

If you've read this far, I can only assume you like my content for one reason or another, even if it's just schadenfreude. So, I'm making this section to tell you why there's stuff on this wiki that has little to nothing to do with the unnamed System.

If I start getting into anything like that, and I think it’s interesting enough to share, I’ll post links to that stuff here. Try not to take it to seriously, though - I’m not. If I *do* get into it a lot, I’ll probably make a new, seperate Wiki in a different project, so [follow my GitHub](https://github.com/s-20).
