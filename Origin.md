# Origin

**Origin is part of Step 1 of [Character Creation](CCSummary.md)**

A Character's Origin is, at its most basic, a character summary. Character creation choices should flow organically from the Origin when at all possible.

In a way, Origin can be said to represent a character's "class" and "race", with elements of back story thrown in for good measure. Origin can imply other abilities for your character, but it isn't "pulled" like a [Trait](Traits.md) or a [Skill](Skills.md). Instead, it modifies the way the dice work for related checks.

## Creating an Origin

Origins are player created, but not in a vacuum. GMs and their game groups should work together to forge everyone's origin during [Session Zero](SessionZero.md). In other words, everyone's Origin should be a cooperative endeavor.

An Origin is between one and three sentences that, in brief, describes the core concept of the character, including things like cultural origin, profession, goals, and/or history. Some examples for a variety of different settings:

- Aya Applehill is a Halfling bounty hunter determined to avenge her slaughtered kin. SHe's been on her own since she was a teenager, and learned her skills from the local thief's guild.
- John Starskipper is a pilot and smuggler with a checkered past and a bounty on his head.
- Jamie is an art thief who seeks to follow in zer father's footsteps, except perhaps with less jail time. Ze went to college for Art History, but dropped out before ze could finish. Jamie has traveled the world in zer quest to steal the most interesting art.
- Dr. Johan Stamos is a paranormal researcher who has a habit of getting himself in over his head. He is a font of occult lore and conspiracy theory, and is terrified of the Outer Gods, about whom he knows too much.

## Origin Modifiers

Origins aren't pulled into checks like other Characteristics. Instead, they modify the way you gather successes on rolls. This can be good, bad, or both, depending on the circumstances.

If a character's Origin would have a positive impact on the check, then when you roll, the dice bounce on a 6+ rather than a 7+. If the character's Origin would have a negative impact, then you count 1s and 2s as Failures instead of just 1s. Both of these can apply to the same check if there are ups and downs to the situation.

## Shifting Origin

Because Origins can contain motivations, they can shift over time. Any time you gain a [Tier](Advancement.md), you can "shift" your origin if something in the game has happened that makes such a change appropriate. Perhaps you've succeeded in avenging someone and now your motives are different. Perhaps instead of being a college student, you're now a graduate.

Whatever the case, you can shift your origin with GM approval whenever you spend an Advancement.

The next step in [Character Creation](CCSummary.md) is to select 2 [Aspects](Aspects.md).
