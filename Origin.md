# Origin

**Origin is part of Step 1 of [Character Creation](CCSummary.md)**

A Character's Origin is, at its most basic, a character summary. Character creation choices should flow organically from the Origin when at all possible.

In a way, Origin can be said to represent a character's "class" and "race", with elements of back story thrown in for good measure. Origin can imply other abilities for your character, but it isn't "pulled" like a [Trait](Traits.md) or a [Skill](Skills.md). Instead, it modifies the way the dice work for related checks.

## Creating an Origin

Origins are player created, but not in a vacuum. GMs and their game groups should work together to forge everyone's origin during [Session Zero](SessionZero.md). In other words, everyone's Origin should be a cooperative endeavor.

An Origin is between one and three sentences that, in brief, describes the core concept of the character, including things like cultural origin, profession, goals, and/or history. Some examples for a variety of different settings:

- Aya Applehill is a Halfling bounty hunter determined to avenge her slaughtered kin. SHe's been on her own since she was a teenager, and learned her skills from the local thief's guild.
- John Starskipper is a pilot and smuggler with a checkered past and a bounty on his head.
- Jamie is an art thief who seeks to follow in zer father's footsteps, except perhaps with less jail time. Ze went to college for Art History, but dropped out before ze could finish. Jamie has traveled the world in zer quest to steal the most interesting art.
- Dr. Johan Stamos is a paranormal researcher who has a habit of getting himself in over his head. He is a font of occult lore and conspiracy theory, and is terrified of the Outer Gods, about whom he knows too much.

## Using Origins

When a character can bring the experiences of their origin to bear on a situation, they can claim special benefits on the check. In addition, there are certain extra things an Origin can do for a character:

- Origins may allow a check that the character couldn't normally make related to knowledge or cultural aspects of the origin
- Origin can be "pulled" like a Trait, adding a die to the check
- The successes for any [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) added to a check related to the character's Origin are doubled
- A Drama Die can be spent in a situation relating to a character's origin to gain one of the following benefits:
  - Gain 2 stack in a special [Connection](Connections.md) related to the character's origin. This connection is strong, but it may be unreliable. The connection becomes unavailable after a time specified by the GM unless you spend [Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md) to make it permanent.
  - Re-roll any Quirks rolled on a check that included a die from the character's Origin; continue to re-roll until no quirks remain.
  - Add something to a scene related to the character's Origin that affects the plot in some way - invent a new Coming of Age ritual, add an ancient species enemy, add a historical detail to your Origin that's useful right now, and so on.
