# Origin

**Origin is part of Step 1 of [Character Creation](CCSummary.md)**

A Character's Origin is a combination of a character summary and a character background. Character creation choices should flow organically from the Origin when at all possible.

In a way, Origin can be said to represent a character's "class" and "race", with elements of back story thrown in for good measure. Origin can imply other abilities for your character, but it can only be "pulled" or "used" in conjunction with [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md).

## Creating an Origin

Origins are player created, but not in a vacuum. GMs and their game groups should work together to forge everyone's origin during [Session Zero](SessionZero.md). In other words, everyone's Origin should be a cooperative endeavor.

An Origin is between one and three sentences that, in brief, describes the core concept of the character, including things like cultural origin, profession, goals, and/or history. Some examples for a variety of different settings:

- Aya Applehill is a Halfling bounty hunter determined to avenge her slaughtered kin. SHe's been on her own since she was a teenager, and learned her skills from the local thief's guild.
- John Starskipper is a pilot and smuggler with a checkered past and a bounty on his head.
- Jamie is an art thief who seeks to follow in zer father's footsteps, except perhaps with less jail time. Ze went to college for Art History, but dropped out before ze could finish. Jamie has traveled the world in zer quest to steal the most interesting art.
- Dr. Stamos is a paranormal researcher who has a habit of getting himself in over his head. He is a font of occult lore and conspiracy theory, and is terrified of the Outer Gods, about whom he knows too much.

## Activating an Origin

Origins aren't pulled like [Traits](Traits.md) or [Skills](Skills.md). Instead, they modify how [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) work. When you use a Drama Die for a check, if the check is directly related to your Origin, you gain one additional die to roll per [Tier](Advancement.md) of the character.

For example, a Tier 1 character would spend one Drama Die and gain two dice to roll, while a Tier 3 character would spend one Drama Die and gain four dice to roll.

Origins can also be used to regain Drama Dice, or gain a [Perk](MarksPerks.md). You can pull your origin into a scene to make things more troublesome or interesting. Using one of the examples above, perhaps Aya hears someone talking about betraying the Thief's Guild, so she immediately confronts them. This might be worth a Drama Die.

## Shifting Origin

Because Origins can contain motivations, they can shift over time. Any time you gain a [Tier](Advancement.md), you can "shift" your origin if something in the game has happened that makes such a change appropriate. Perhaps you've succeeded in avenging someone and now your motives are different. Perhaps instead of being a college student, you're now a graduate.

Whatever the case, you can shift your origin with GM approval whenever you spend an Advancement.
