# Wound Threshold

A character's Wound Threshold represents how much physical punishment they can take. Basically, when you have Wounds equal to your Wound Threshold, you're dying.

The default starting value for Wound Threshold is 5, but it can vary quite a bit depending on the [Parameters](Parameters.md) of the game. The setting, genre, and tone can all impact starting Wound Thresholds.

Character [Origins](Origin.md) may impact Wound Threshold as well - a Dwarf can probably take more punishment than a Halfling, for example.

Damage you take in the Unnamed System comes in the form of Wounds, which are a special sort of [Condition](Conditions.md). As your wounds pile up, things get worse and worse for you.

## Off Balance

Once you have two Wounds, further Wounds knock you Off Balance, giving you a stack in that [Condition](Conditions.md). You gain one stack of the condition each time you gain more wounds, not with each individual wound.

## Reeling

If you have Wounds equal to more than half your Wound Threshold, you're Reeling. When you're reeling, you move more slowly, can't hit as hard, and have trouble maintaining your footing.

All your dice pools are reduced by 1 unless you burn a Trait or Aspect for the check. You remain Reeling until your wounds go back down below half your Wound Threshold.

## Massive Damage

A single massive blow can be deadly. If you take more than half your Wound Threshold in damage in a single hit, you must burn an Aspect or gain 1 Stack in the Dying [Condition](Conditions.md).

## Dying

When a character takes Massive Damage, or their Wounds are equal to their Wound Threshold, they gain 1 stack of Dying. Any further wounds add 1 to the stack.

Each round, at the end of your turn, you must make a Death Check by rolling dice equal to your Dying stack. Any Failures are added to the character's Dying stack.

When the character's stack of Dying Conditions is equal to their Wound Threshold, they're gone, although they may be entitled to a Heroic Action; see [Death](Death.md) for more details.

## Option: Battered

If you want a less lethal game, you can add a Battered Pool with 5 or 10 levels on it. When a character takes a wound, they can spend from their Battered pool to negate the wound. If a single source causes more than one wound, only one can be countered with the Battered Pool.

Losing points from the Battered pool doesn't cause an ill effects, but may be used as a trigger for [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md). Once your Battered pool is empty, you can no longer negate wounds with it, and all further damage adds to your Wound Stack.

Some effects or events in game may bypass the battered pool. For instance falling in a vat of acid may cause damage directly to wounds. This should generally be avoided, however, allowing the player to spend Battered to negate some or all of the damage with good description (I grab the edge of the vat at the last second!).

Battered is an example of a Special Ability with a [Energy Pool](Energy.md). See [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) for more information about how these things are put together.
