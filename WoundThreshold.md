# Wound Threshold

A character's Wound Threshold represents how much physical punishment they can take. Basically, when you have Wounds equal to your Wound Threshold, you're dying.

The default starting value for Wound Threshold is 5, but it can vary quite a bit depending on the [Parameters](Parameters.md) of the game. The setting, genre, and tone can all impact starting Wound Thresholds.

Character [Origins](Origin.md) may impact Wound Threshold as well - a Dwarf can probably take more punishment than a Halfling, for example.

Damage you take in the Unnamed System comes in the form of Wounds, which are a special sort of [Condition](Conditions.md). As your wounds pile up, things get worse and worse for you.

## Off Balance

Once you have two Wounds, further Wounds knock you Off Balance, giving you a stack in that [Condition](Conditions.md). You gain one stack of the condition each time you gain more wounds, not with each individual wound.

## Reeling

If you have Wounds equal to more than half your Wound Threshold, you're Reeling. When you're reeling, you move more slowly, can't hit as hard, and have trouble maintaining your footing.

All your dice pools are reduced by 1 unless you burn a Trait or Aspect for the check. You remain Reeling until your wounds go back down below half your Wound Threshold.

## Massive Damage

A single massive blow can be deadly. If you take more than half your Wound Threshold in damage in a single hit, you must burn an Aspect or gain 1 Stack in the Dying [Condition](Conditions.md).

## Dying

When a character takes Massive Damage, or their Wounds are equal to their Wound Threshold, they gain 1 stack of Dying. Any further wounds add 1 to the stack.

Each round, at the end of your turn, you must make a Death Check by rolling dice equal to your Dying stack. Any Failures are added to the character's Dying stack.

When the character's stack of Dying Conditions is equal to their Wound Threshold, they're gone, although they may be entitled to a Heroic Action; see [Death](Death.md) for more details.

## Battered Track

If you want a less lethal game, you can add a Battered Track. Each player gets 2 Battered levels per Wound. Whenever a player would take a Wound, they're Battered instead. Every 2 times they're Battered, they lose a Wound and lose one action on their next turn in [Combat](Combat.md).

Certain things bypass the Battered track, depending on the campaign. Some Examples: 

- In a mostly realistic campaign, getting shot might go directly to wounds. 
- In a campaign where supernatural creatures battle each other in a secret gothic-punk society, perhaps the injuries inflicted by supernatural creatures go directly to wounds.
- In a game where you're fighting faeires (or *are* faeries), cold iron might go direct to Wounds

THe idea is that it gives you two different levels of injury to work with. In a superhero campaign, you might want to make the battered tracks 5 or more per Wound - even "super normals" like Batman and The Punisher can take a lot of punishment, and that's part of the fun!
