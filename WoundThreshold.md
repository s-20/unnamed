# Wound Threshold and Wounds

This section describes the two measure of how much damage your character can sustain before they're *in trouble* (or ***Dead***, which is just a more advanced version of *in trouble* that it's a lot harder to come back from).

Wound Threshold indicates how difficult it is to do real harm to a character. When damage comes your way, you make a Wound Threshold check to avoid being hurt *badly*. If you fail the check, you take a Wound. Not only do Wounds have in-game lasting consequences, you only get a few before you're down for the count; one more after that, and you're dead.

## Wounds

A Wound represents serious harm to a character. Wounds aren't trivial, abstract measures of damage - that's what [Burned](Burn.md) [Characteristics](Characteristic.md) or Wound Threshold is for. Taking a Wound means you've been seriously injured.

What happens when a character is wounded depends on the nature of the wound - taking shrapnel from a claymore antipersonnel mine won't cause the same problems as getting caught in a bear trap or being set on fire.

Unlike burned characteristics, Wounds are difficult to recover from, especially without help. Even after a Wound has been removed, a character may still suffer some continuing effects - a limp, a scar, a missing eye - not all wounds have such lasting effects, but it can happen. As has been stated - Wounds are serous business, and you're best off avoiding them if you can.

### Getting a Wound

You get a Wound whenever your character would be physically injured in a non-trivial way. Bumps, bruises, scrapes, and minor cuts don't count - just the bad stuff.

You'll usually get a Wound Threshold check (see below) to avoid the injury, but sometimes it's unavoidable - if you step in molten lava, you're going to take at least one wound, threshold be damned. You *always* get a Wound Threshold check to avoid a Wound from incoming damage in [Combat](Combat.md), however.

Each Wound is unique and depends on the circumstances of the injury. When you receive the wound, the GM will tell you the nature of the wound, and you can decide together the consequences. 

Mark 1 Wound on your character sheet, along with the consequences. Keep a running tally of your Wounds - you only get a few.

## Wound Threshold

All characters begin with a Wound Threshold of 1, and can improve it as though it were a [Trait](Traits.md) up to a stack of 5 for most games, or as high as 10 for super hero or high-action/adventure games. The cap for Wound Threshold is determined when you set up [Parameters](Parameters.md), but it's 5 unless noted otherwise.

When you would take a Wound (unless it's unavoidable), you make a Wound Threshold check. This is a normal check, except you can usually only pull your Wound Threshold and one other appropriate [Characteristic](Characteristic.md), and you cannot [Burn](Burn.md) any characteristics you pull, although [Meta-Traits](MetaTraits.md) that normally have to be burned to be used can still be pulled without burning them.

Depending on how severe the incoming harm is, the check might be made with [Hard Dice](DiceTypes.md). If you get at least 1 success, you don't take the Wound. Reduce anything pulled into the check by 1 (as though you had Burned it) whether you succeed or not.

You don't always get off without consequences, though - you may have a penalty or be somewhat disabled going forward, depending on what was going to hurt you. This could cost you a [Move](Combat.md) on your next turn, reduce a [Trait](Traits.md) because you got a bit battered, or some other effect. Rolling [Quirks](Quirks.md) increases the chance of having some sort of minor consequence like this.

## Wound Consequences

Because it's a serious injury, you can't just push through a Wound and keep acting like nothing happened. Wounds affect you in some way until they are healed, and sometimes even after that.

The consequences of a wound vary from injury to injury. For example:

- A Wound from being set on fire might cause enough pain that you're [Hampered](Conditions.md) until the pain subsides, and could leave you scarred afterwards, which could affect social interactions.
- A bad hit from a sword strike could sever your hand. This has obvious immediate consequences (you're down a hand!), and might also come with blood loss or pain-related consequences. Depending on genre and setting, the loss of a hand could be permanent!
- An arrow to the knee would certainly leave you [Hampered or Immobile](Conditions.md), and could mean an end to your adventuring career if you live in Tamriel.
- A serious fall might leave you with one or more broken bones, and maybe even internal bleeding requiring medical care to prevent additional Wounds.

You are welcome to come up with your own consequences when the GM (or other player, if you're doing PVP) describes what happens, but the GM is the final arbiter. Keep in mind that the consequences should be grave.

## Wound Capacity

Characters can only take so many Wounds before being taken out of action. This could mean unconscious, but it can also mean too injured to effectively act, but they can still communicate.

How many Wounds you can take depends on the "feel" you;re going for in your story. The default is 3, but if you want a grittier, more brutal game, reduce it to 2. For an Indiana Jones style action-adventure game, you might want to up it to 4, and for superheroes or demigods, you could go as high as 5.

Generally, speaking, the cap should be at 5, however, or you risk trivializing the serious nature of wounds.

## Healing

Unlike burned characteristics, Wounds take a while to heal, and can leave permanent after effects. You can go with a more realistic feel if you like, doing research into things like how long it takes to heal a broken leg, or what the adjustment period is after someone loses an eye.

These rules, however, provide a streamlined way of handing Wounds in a way that keeps a decent level of verisimilitude without weighing you down with used Medical School textbooks. Also, it's a bit more fun this way,

### Natural Healing

It takes you about 1 week of rest to get rid of a Wound. If you hit 3 Wounds (or whatever the Wound Capacity is for your game), it takes a month of rest to get rid of the first wound, and then a week apiece for the rest.

This assumes *rest* - you can't be doing anything more intense than reading on the couch or watching T.V., you're getting enough sleep in a safe and comfortable environment, you're eating well, and so on. If you're not getting rest, then the GM is encouraged to add anything from a few days to a few weeks or longer to your convalescence.

The lasting effects of some wounds - a lost hand, severe scars, a limp - may be permanent. Those that aren't permanent can be expected to last twice as long as your convalescence. For example, if you have a temporary limp from a Wound, and you are recovering from two wounds total, your wounds would be gone after 2 weeks of rest, but the limp would continue for another two weeks after.

The GM can rule that any given wound is sever enough that it requires special care to recover, or that it takes longer than usual. For instance, if you broke your leg, the GM might say that it takes a month to heal instead of a week, and if you've been shot, the GM might require a doctor's care for you to recover at all (see below).

### First Aid and Medicine

Some Wounds require immediate attention, some can be patched up with a bit of time, and some require a hospital (or the equivalent). First Aid and Medicine are what you need here.
