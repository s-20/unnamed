# Wound Threshold and Wounds

This section describes the two measures of how much damage your character can sustain before they're *in trouble* (or ***Dead***, which is just a more advanced version of *in trouble* that it's a lot harder to come back from).

Wound Threshold indicates how difficult it is to do real harm to a character. When damage comes your way, you make a Wound Threshold check to avoid being hurt *badly*. If you fail the check, you take a Wound. Not only do Wounds have the potential for lasting consequences, you only get a few before you're down for the count or taken out for good.

## Wounds

A Wound represents serious harm to a character. Wounds aren't trivial, abstract measures of damage; that's what [Burned](Burn.md) [Characteristics](Characteristic.md) are for. Taking a Wound means you've been seriously injured.

What happens when a character is wounded depends on the nature of the wound. Taking shrapnel from a claymore antipersonnel mine won't cause the same problems as getting caught in a bear trap or being set on fire.

Unlike burned characteristics, Wounds are difficult to recover from, especially without help. Even after a Wound has been removed, a character may still suffer some continuing effects. A limp, a missing eye, a permanent aversion to the smell of peaches, and other lasting indicators of past trauma are collectively called [Scars](Scars.md).

### Getting a Wound

You get a Wound whenever your character would be physically, psychologically, or otherwise injured in a non-trivial way. Bumps, bruises, scrapes, and minor cuts don't count, just the bad stuff.

You'll usually get a Wound Threshold check (see below) to avoid the injury, but sometimes it's unavoidable: if you step in molten lava, you're going to take at least one wound. You *always* get a Wound Threshold check to avoid a Wound from incoming damage in [Combat](Combat.md), however.

Each Wound is unique and depends on the circumstances of the injury. When you receive the wound, the GM will tell you the nature of the wound and any ensuing complications; you can feel free to embellish as you like, within reason.

Mark 1 Wound on your character sheet, along with the consequences. Keep a running tally of your Wounds - you only get a few.

## Wound Threshold Value

Wound Threshold is a [Statistic](Statistics.md), and has a numerical value representing how much harm you can sustain before being taken out of action, possibly permanently. This number defaults to 3, but can be lower for especially deadly games, or higher for games with a more cinematic feel.

When you would take a Wound, you make a Wound Threshold check by rolling dice equal to your Wound Threshold Value. You can't pull Characteristics into a Wound Threshold check, and you roll one fewer die for each Wound you currently have. Each [Effort](Effort.md) you roll with the check negates one Wound.

Even if you manage to avoid the wound, you don't get off without consequences. You lose an [Action](Combat.md) on your next turn in combat. You'll also have some outward sign of injury, although it isn't bad enough to be debilitating. 

Finally, although the injury isn't potentially mortal, it is still a bad thing: burn one or more [Characteristics](Characteristics.md), depending on the nature of the wound. For instance, physical trauma might require you to burn a [Strong Trait](Traits.md), while psychological trauma might leave you temporarily less [Clever](Traits.md).

## Wound Consequences

Because it's a serious injury, you can't just push through a Wound and keep acting like nothing happened. Wounds affect you in some way until they are healed, and sometimes even after that.

The consequences of a wound usually mean dice penalties on certain checks. For example, a Wound to your favored hand might mean penalties to anything requiring eye-hand co-ordination and attack checks. An injured leg might mean reduced movement. Psychological trauma might cause a penalty to resist further trauma or make it more difficult for you to focus on a given task.

You are welcome to come up with your own consequences when the GM (or other player, if you're doing PVP) describes what happens, but the GM is the final arbiter. Whatever the consequences, Wounds represent *serious* trauma; unless you're the Black Knight, it's not just a scratch.

## Healing

Unlike burned characteristics, Wounds take a while to heal, and can leave permanent aftereffects. By default, Wounds go away at a rate of about 1 per week of rest, unless story demands otherwise. More severe injuries may take longer, and may have lasting consequences. Medical treatment, magic, and other intervention can heal wounds significantly faster. There's no hard and fast rule for this. Just follow your instincts and keep in mind that story is king.

You can go with a more realistic feel if you prefer, doing research into things like how long it takes to heal a broken leg, or what the adjustment period is after someone loses an eye. If that's what your story requires, and that's what your group is into, more power to you.

## NPCS, Background Players, Monsters, and Wounds

[NPCs](NPCs.md) use different rules for dealing with harm. See the NPC article for more information.
