# Wound Threshold and Wounds

This section describes the two measure of how much damage your character can sustain before they're *in trouble* (or ***Dead***, which is just a more advanced version of *in trouble* that it's a lot harder to come back from).

Wound Threshold indicates how difficult it is to do real harm to a character. When damage comes your way, you make a Wound Threshold check to avoid being hurt *badly*. If you fail the check, you take a Wound. Not only do Wounds have the potential for lasting consequences, you only get a few before you're down for the count or taken out for good.

## Wounds

A Wound represents serious harm to a character. Wounds aren't trivial, abstract measures of damage - that's what [Burned](Burn.md) [Characteristics](Characteristic.md) are for. Taking a Wound means you've been seriously injured.

What happens when a character is wounded depends on the nature of the wound - taking shrapnel from a claymore antipersonnel mine won't cause the same problems as getting caught in a bear trap or being set on fire.

Unlike burned characteristics, Wounds are difficult to recover from, especially without help. Even after a Wound has been removed, a character may still suffer some continuing effects - a limp, a scar, a missing eye, et cetera. Not all wounds have such lasting effects.

### Getting a Wound

You get a Wound whenever your character would be physically injured in a non-trivial way. Bumps, bruises, scrapes, and minor cuts don't count - just the bad stuff.

You'll usually get a Wound Threshold check (see below) to avoid the injury, but sometimes it's unavoidable - if you step in molten lava, you're going to take at least one wound, threshold bedamned. You *always* get a Wound Threshold check to avoid a Wound from incoming damage in [Combat](Combat.md), however.

Each Wound is unique and depends on the circumstances of the injury. When you receive the wound, the GM will tell you the nature of the wound and any ensuing complications; you can feel free to embellish as you like, within reason.

Mark 1 Wound on your character sheet, along with the consequences. Keep a running tally of your Wounds - you only get a few.

## Wound Threshold

Wound Threshold is a special [Characteristic](Characteristic.md). All characters start with the same number of ranks, determined as part of the campaign's [Paramerters](Parameters.md). The default is 3, but can be higher for more cinematic play, or lower for games where life is cheap and survival is difficult.

When you would take a Wound (unless it's unavoidable), you make a Wound Threshold check by rolling your Wound Threshold dice. You can't usually pull additional Characteristics into a Wound Threshold check, although you can gain [Synergy](Synergy.md) normally. If you're going to burn an [Aspect](Aspects.md) to avoid the damage, you have to do that *instead* of rolling.

Avoiding the Wound ususally only requires 1 [Effort](Effort.md), but can require more if the incoming attack was especially brutal.

Even if you manage to avoid the wound,however, you don't always get off without consequences, especially if you roll [Quirks](Quirks.md) on the Wound Threshold check. You usually lose a [Move](Combat.md) on your next turn in combat. Other minor effects are possible - noticable injury, a limp that doesn't hamper movement, minor burn, and so on. These don't count as a Wound - you evaded that - just more bumps and bruises that others might notice.

### Getting Worse

You take a penalty to your WOund Threshold pool equal to the number of wounds you've sustained. If you have a number of wounds equal to your base Wound Threshold (that is, without [Armor](Stuff.md) or other factors), you're *in trouble*, on the verge of death. One more Wound and you're a goner!

## Wound Consequences

Because it's a serious injury, you can't just push through a Wound and keep acting like nothing happened. Wounds affect you in some way until they are healed, and sometimes even after that.

The consequences of a wound vary from injury to injury. For example:

- A Wound from being set on fire might cause enough pain that you're [Hampered](Conditions.md) until the pain subsides, and could leave you scarred afterwards, which could affect social interactions.
- A bad hit from a sword strike could sever your hand. This has obvious immediate consequences (you're down a hand!), and might also come with blood loss or pain-related consequences.
- An arrow to the knee would certainly leave you [Hampered or Immobile](Conditions.md), and could mean an end to your adventuring career if you live in Tamriel.
- A serious fall might leave you with one or more broken bones, and maybe even internal bleeding requiring medical care to prevent additional Wounds.

You are welcome to come up with your own consequences when the GM (or other player, if you're doing PVP) describes what happens, but the GM is the final arbiter. WHatever the consequences, Wounds represent *serious* trauma - it's not just a scratch.

## Healing

Unlike burned characteristics, Wounds take a while to heal, and can leave permanent aftereffects. By default, Wounds go away at a rate of about 1 per week of rest, unless story demands otherwise. More severe injuries may take longer, and may have lasting consequences. Medical treatment, magic, and other intervention can heal wounds significantly faster. There's no hard and fast rule for this - just follow your instincts and rememeber that story is king.

You can go with a more realistic feel if you prefer, doing research into things like how long it takes to heal a broken leg, or what the adjustment period is after someone loses an eye. If that's what your story requires, and that's what your group is into, more power to you.

## NPCS, Background Players, Monsters, and Wounds

You don't usually need to track wounds as carefully for NPCs, and they don't get Wound Threshold checks (with rare exceptions). Instead, they just have a Defense - the amount of Effort it takes to hit them - that goes down with their Wounds. If the player hits them, they lose dice from their [Action Pool](ActionPool.md) as well. If they lose enough dice, they get taken out. See [Suporting Cast](SupportingCast.md) for more details.
