# Drama Dice

Drama Dice are a shared pool of dice that players can use to accomplish goals or influence scenes. They are something of a "meta mechanic"; although they can be thought of as luck or extra effort - and, in fact, are used that way at times - what they really are is a tool to give players more control over their character's fates and the story.

Each campaign starts with a number of Drama Dice equal to 2 + 1 for each player. The total pool of Drama Dice increases as characters [Advance](Advancement.md), with a final limit of 10 dice. All of the dice in the pool are d6s.

## Pulling Drama Dice

At any time, a player can pull up to two Drama Dice into a check. These dice are rolled and counted for Successes/Failure normally. In this way, Drama DIce function as flashes of inspiration, luck, or any arbitrary improvement in circumstance.

This can used for checks where the character doesn't have any characteristics they can pull into the check, allowing them a chance to do something they have no idea how to do.

## Spending Drama Dice

Players may also spend Drama Dice to try to affect a scene. When using a Drama Die in this way, the player describes the change they want to make, and then rolls the die. On any result of 4+, everything proceeds as planned.

On a 1 to 3, what the player described still happens, but with a twist that makes it more complicated, interesting, or perhaps a bit less helpful than the player would have hoped.

Using a Drama Die to affect a scene in this way can take many forms:

- It can allow the player to describe a brief flashback of them anticipating the situation and preparing for it
  - *Of course I have a pocket knife. They always tie you up.*
- It could forge a connection with an NPC that changes the circumstances of the encounter
  - *Wait - is that guard my cousin?*
- It can add an object to the scene
  - *There's a chandelier I can swing from, right?*
- It can cause some other coincidental event that helps the players
  - *Suddenly the light bulb flashes and goes out!*
- And so on

Although the GM can overrule any scene-altering Drama Dice usage, they are encouraged to only do so under the rarest of circumstances, reserving veto power for when the request is impossible or disruptive to the game.
