# Drama Dice

Drama Dice are a shared pool of dice that players can use to accomplish goals or influence scenes. They are something of a "meta mechanic"; although they can be thought of as luck or extra effort, what they really are is a tool to give players more control over their character's fates and the story.

By default, a game starts with a Drama Dice pool equal to the number of players in the group.

## Pulling Drama Dice

At any time, a player can pull Drama Dice into a check. These dice are rolled and counted for Successes normally. In this way, Drama Dice function as flashes of inspiration, luck, bizarrely specific knowledge, or any arbitrary improvement in circumstance. This can used for checks where the character doesn't have any [Characteristics](Characteristic.md) they can pull into the check, allowing them a chance to do something they have no idea how to do by “lucking” into success.

Unlike [Characteristics](Characteristics.md), pulled Drama Dice are removed from the pool. For any given check, you can only pull one Drama Die, plus one if you have at least one rank of [Lucky](MetaTraits.md), but other players can pull a similar number of dice *for you* to add to the check. In fact, other players can pull dice to add to your check *even if you don’t pull any*.

## Burning Drama Dice

Players may also Burn Drama Dice to try to affect a scene. When using a Drama Die in this way, the player describes the change they want to make, and the die is removed from the pool. Using a Drama Die to affect a scene in this way can take many forms:

- It can allow the player to describe a brief flashback of them anticipating the situation and preparing for it
  - *Before I left my house, I remembered that last time we weint investigating in a creepy old house, the bad guys tied us up - so I brought my pocket knife. Then, just before they searched us, I slipped it into John's sock.
- It could forge a connection with an NPC that changes the circumstances of the encounter
  - *Wait - is that guard my cousin? Holy crap, it is!
- It can add an object to the scene
  - *There's a chandelier I can swing from, right?*
- It can cause some other coincidental event that helps the players
  - *And that's when the power went out!*
- And so on

The changes must be limited in scope, and cannot cause a massive disruption of the narrative or directly harm characters or NPCs. Changes can only add to a scene - you can't make things vanish that were already there. In short, they have to make narrative sense.

When you "burn" a Drama Die in this way, the benefit comes from the scene rewrite, and you don't add dice to any checks. That having been said, it can create favorable circumstances that reduce the [Effort](Effort.md) required for a check, make a new task possible, or otherwise open up new opportunities that are beneficial, even if you don't get a bonus to a check.

## Gaining Drama Dice

At the start of each session, the Drama Dice pool is reset to the number of players.

- If you roll no [Effort](Effort.md) on a check, add a die to the Drama Dice pool
- Any time a PC takes a [Wound](WoundThreshold.md), add a die to the Drama Pool
- If a PC dies, add Drama Dice to the pool equal to the number of players,
- Exceptional Role-play, cool actions, or something that advances the story significantly adds one or more dice to the pool

There is no limit to the size of the Drama Dice pool, but it does reset at the start of each session, so it doesn't make sense to horde them!
