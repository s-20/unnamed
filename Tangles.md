# Tangles

Tangles represent things that your character has to deal with that make their life more difficult. Tangles are usually noted in a short phrase.

Mechanically, Tangles are a way to regain [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md), and can even be pulled into a check under the right circumstances. Tangles can also be used against you, pulling dice from a pool, increasing the difficulty of a check an possibly introducing or changing the consequences of that check.

## Gaining Tangles

Tangles can be established during character creation or during play. At any time that you think adding a Tangle would be interesting or appropriate, then you can add one. Adding a Tangle restores a Drama Die to the pool.

During character creation, try to keep your number of Tangles reasonable - under 5 is a good guideline.

## Entangled

If your Tangle comes up, pull it into the check or the scene, and act on it. This is called "Entangling". Entanglement can affect a few checks, or it can affect an entire scene, depending on the circumstances. FOr example, having to retrieve something from the edge of a cliff might entangle a single check if you have Acrophobia, while having to track down someone in a casino when you have a Gambling Use Disorder might affect the entire scene.

### Entangled Checks

Tangles make things more difficult in general. This usually means that the check requires more [Effort](Effort.md) - 1 more Effort per rank in the Tangle. You can invoke an Entanglement on a check, but so can anyone else in case you forget.

[Quirks](Quirks.md) also become more important when a check is Entangled. Every Quirk you roll on the check means your Tangle has interfered in an increasingly problematic manner. If you roll more Quirks than [Effort](Effort.md), you fail at what you're trying to do, and the Tangle determines the result. As usual, you only completely fail if doing so won’t stall the game.

Making an Entangled check restores one [Drama Die](DramaDice.md) to the pool unless your Quirks outnumber your Effort. In that case, it restores two.

### Entangled Scenes

If your Tangle would be part of a scene (or *is* a part of the scene), call it immediately and add a [Drama Die](DramaDice.md) to the pool. Once the scene is Entangled, you have to role play it appropriately. At the end of the scene, add another Drama Die to the pool.

As a side bonus, during an Entangled scene, you gain [Synergy](Synergy.md) for any Entangled checks.

## Resolving Tangles

If something happens that makes a Tangle no longer make sense or otherwise would remove it from your character, that Tangle is Resolved, or Untangled if you prefer. The Tangle might be removed or changed to a different related tangle - for example, if you have an enemy that you defeat, you lose your enemy Tangle; if in the process you discover that *they* had a boss, and you’re on their radar, the tangle might change into this new, probably more dangerous, enemy. And so it goes.

If you resolve a Tangle during the game, add 2 dice to the [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) pool. If you pick up a new Tangle, add 1 die to the Drama Dice pool. Either way, make any appropriate notes on your character sheet.
