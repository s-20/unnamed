# Tangles

Tangles represent problems your character has to deal with that make their life more difficult. Tangles are usually noted in a short phrase.

Mechanically, Tangles are a way to regain [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md), and can even be pulled into a check under the right circumstances. Tangles can also be used against you, pulling dice from a pool, increasing the difficulty of a check and possibly changing the consequences of both failure and success.

## Gaining Tangles

Tangles can be established during character creation or during play. At any time that you think adding a Tangle would be interesting or appropriate, then you can add one. Adding a Tangle restores a Drama Die to the pool. During character creation, try to keep your number of Tangles reasonable; somewhere between 1 and 3 individual Tangles with no more than 5 ranks total is a good guideline.

## Entangled

If your Tangle comes up, say so and act on it. This is called *Entangling*. Entanglement can affect a few checks, or it can affect an entire scene, depending on the circumstances. For example, having to retrieve something from the edge of a cliff might entangle a single check if you have Acrophobia, while having to track down someone in a casino when you have a Gambling Use Disorder might affect the entire scene.

Tangles make things more difficult in general. This usually means that the check requires 1 more [Effort](Effort.md) per rank in the Tangle, but other consequences are possible. You can invoke an Entanglement on a check, but so can anyone else in case you forget.

[Quirks](Quirks.md) also become more important when a check is Entangled. Every Quirk you roll on the check means your Tangle has interfered in an increasingly problematic manner. If you roll more Quirks than [Effort](Effort.md), you fail at what you're trying to do, and the Tangle determines the result. As usual, you only completely fail if doing so won’t stall the game.

Making an Entangled check adds one [Drama Die](DramaDice.md) to the pool.

> *Entangled Scenes*
> 
> Sometimes, instead of a check or two, a whole scene is a trigger for your Tangle. This results in an Entangled Scene. During an Entangled Scene, you restore 1 Drama Die as soon as the scene becomes entangled, and *all* of your checks during the scene are considered Entangled.
> 
> You can only restore a number of Drama Dice in an Entangled Scene equal to twice your ranks in the Tangle.

## Resolving Tangles

If something happens that makes a Tangle no longer make sense or otherwise would remove it from your character, that Tangle is Resolved, or Untangled if you prefer. The Tangle can be removed, or it can be changed to a different related tangle. 

For example, if you have an enemy that you defeat, you lose your enemy Tangle; if in the process you discover that *they* had a boss, and you’re on their radar, the tangle might change into this new, probably more dangerous, enemy. And so it goes.

If you resolve a Tangle, add 2 dice to the [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) pool and gain an [Advancement](Advancement.md).
