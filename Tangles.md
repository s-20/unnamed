# Tangles

Tangles represent things that your character has to deal with that make their life more difficult. Tangles are usually noted in a short phrase.

Mechanically, Tangles are a way to regain [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md), and can even be pulled into a check under the right circumstances. Tangles can also be used against you, pulling dice from a pool, increasing the difficulty of a check, or costing you a [Drama Die](DramaDice.md).

## Gaining Tangles

Tangles can be established during character creation or during play. At any time that you think adding a Tangle would be interesting or appropriate, then you can add one. You don't immediately gain anything for doing so, but as noted below there are benefits to having Tangles.

During character creation, try to keep your number of Tangles reasonable - under 5 is a good guideline.

## Entangled

If your Tangle comes up, pull it into the check or the scene, and act on it. This is called "Entangling".

### Entangled Checks

If your Tangle would interfere with a check you're making, then the Quirks become more important. Every Quirk you roll on the check means your Tangle has interfered in a more problematic manner. If you roll more Quirks than Effort, you fail at what you're trying to do, and the Tangle determines the result.

Making an Entangled check restores one [Drama Die](DramaDice.md) to the pool unless your Quirks outnumber your Effort. In that case, it restores two.

### Entangled Scenes

If your Tangle would be part of a scene (or *is* a part of the scene), call it immediately and add a [Drama Die](DramaDice.md) to the pool. Once the scene is Entangled, you have to role play it appropriately. At the end of the scene, add another Drama Die to the pool.

As a side bonus, during an Entangled scene, you may be able to pull the Tangle into a check. Doing so provides an additional die to the check, and makes that check Entangled as described above.

## Getting Untangled

You can lose Tangles as easily as you get them. If it makes sens in the story for your Tangle to go away, then it does. Losing a Tangle adds two dice to the [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) pool.
