# Tangles

Tangles represent problems your character has to deal with that make their life more difficult. Tangles are usually noted in a short phrase.

Mechanically, Tangles are a way to regain [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md), and can even be pulled into a check under the right circumstances. Tangles can also be used against you, pulling dice from a pool, increasing the difficulty of a check and possibly changing the consequences of both failure and success.

## Gaining Tangles

Tangles can be established during character creation or during play. At any time that you think adding a Tangle would be interesting or appropriate, then you can add one. Adding a Tangle restores a Drama Die to the pool. During character creation, try to keep your number of Tangles reasonable; somewhere between 1 and 3 individual Tangles with no more than 5 ranks total is a good guideline.

## Entangled

If your Tangle comes up, say so and act on it. This is called *Entangling*. Entanglement can affect a few checks, or it can affect an entire scene, depending on the circumstances. For example, having to retrieve something from the edge of a cliff might entangle a single check if you have Acrophobia, while having to track down someone in a casino when you have a Gambling Use Disorder might affect the entire scene. You can invoke an Entanglement on a check, but so can anyone else in case you forget.

Tangles make things more difficult in general. With a single rank in a Tangle, this means that the check requires a roll of 6 to generate [Effort](Effort.md), rather than a 5 or 6.  Additional consequences are possible; a Tangle might make you automatically fail at something, cause unintended consequences, or anything else you (or the GM) can think of.

At two ranks, [Quirks](Quirks.md) become more important when a check is Entangled. Every Quirk you roll on the check means your Tangle has interfered in an increasingly problematic manner, cancelling successes at a 1 for 1 rate. If you roll more Quirks than [Effort](Effort.md), you fail at what you're trying to do, and the Tangle determines the result. As usual, you only completely fail if doing so won’t stall the game, but **something** bad happens related to the Tangle.

Additional Ranks in a Tangle increase the [Difficulty](Challenge.md) of anything related to it at a 1:1 rate.

Making an Entangled check adds one [Drama Die](DramaDice.md) to the pool. No more than 2 dice can be added to the Drama Dice by an individual character in a single scene (except in the case of the *whole scene* being entangled; see below).

> *Entangled Scenes*
> 
> Sometimes, instead of a check or two, a whole scene is a trigger for your Tangle. This results in an Entangled Scene. During an Entangled Scene, you restore 1 Drama Die as soon as the scene becomes entangled, and *all* of your checks during the scene are considered Entangled.
> 
> If an entire scene is Entangled, all your checks add to the Drama Dice, and you can add 5 or more Drama Dice to the total. If you add five or more dice to the total, however, things start going very badly for you. You start to automatically fail (as if you'd rolled no Effort and 1 Quirk) for *all* your checks thereafter. You should still make checks for things like combat, but everything else fails or achieves a minimal Entangled success, and you stop adding to the Drama Dice pool after your fifth check.

## Resolving Tangles

If something happens that makes a Tangle no longer make sense or otherwise would remove it from your character, that Tangle is Resolved, or Untangled if you prefer. The Tangle can be removed, or it can be changed to a different related tangle. 

For example, if you have an enemy that you defeat, you lose your enemy Tangle; if in the process you discover that *they* had a boss, and you’re on their radar, the tangle might change into this new, probably more dangerous, enemy. And so it goes.

If you resolve a Tangle, add 2 dice to the [Drama Dice](DramaDice.md) pool and gain an [Advancement](Advancement.md). In addition, all characters in the campaign tracking [Momentum](Energy.md) increase their Momentum total by one, and if the character who resolved their Tangle tracks Momentum, increase theirs by an additional 1; this bonus lasts until it's used, and doesn't fade even if the character's Momentum normally fades.
