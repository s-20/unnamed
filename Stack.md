# Stack

When a characteristic is particularly strong or influential, you may have more than one in it's Stack. That is, when you pull it for a dice roll or it is otherwise factored into play or a check, it counts equal to its stack, rather than at 1.

As a simple example, say you want your character to be not just Strong, but Very Strong. When making your character, you put three ranks into the Strong [Trait](Traits.md), giving them a Stack of 3.

## Benefits of a Stack

When pulling a characteristic with a Stack above 1, you pull that many dice into the roll. So to continue the example above, whenever the character needed to lift a heavy weight, or perhaps when they punched someone, and they pulled their Strong trait into the check, they would gain 3 dice for the check.

Stacking also comes in handy when you [Burn](Burn.md) a characteristic. Each time you burn a characteristic, it is temporarily lowered by 1. Having a higher Stack means you can burn the characteristic more often, although this can be dangerous (especially in the case of [Personal Connections](Connections.md)).

## Zero Stack

If you don't have any ranks in a characteristic, you have Zero Stack in it. For most characteristics, this just means that you can't use it to generate successes, and you can't burn it.
