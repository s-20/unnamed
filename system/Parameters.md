# Parameters

This page discusses establishing the parameters of the campaign. It will discuss the "session zero", deciding on a genre of play, levels of realism, and a variety of other topics.

All of this is stuff that you need to go before every new campaign, and it's best to do it in a group (in person or online), so that everyone is on the same page when the game starts. You can usually also take care of character creation while discussing these things, although it's best to get a pretty good handle on all of the below before you get to deep into character meat and potatoes.

## Genre and Theme

Genre and Theme are what sort of story the game is, and what it will deal with.
(more text to be added)

### Realism

How "realistic" the game is expected to be - hardcore realism (like Saving Private Ryan), presence and influence of magic, super-science, comic-book physics, and so on.

### Special Abilities

What [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) are available. In this case, we're also talking about the types available - for instance, in a Science Fiction game you might allow Special Abilities based on psionics, but not magic. Also important is a discussion of the relative power level of any Special Abilities.

Theme and Genre are a good guide here, as is Realism. Are you playing a Fantasy game? Great! How powerful is magic? How common is it? Are there non-human races? What powers do they have?

### Combat and Wound Threshold

Basically, how much combat can be expected and how much punishment can the characters take.

#### Wound Threshold

[Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md) gets its own article, but in brief, it measures how much punishment a character can take, and means different things depending on how much of it you have. Low Wound Thresholds reflect a more "realistic" perception of damage, where taking a wound actually represents significant injury. High Wound Thresholds are more cinematic, reflecting not just actual injury, but your luck and ability to avoid or soak damage.

As a rough guide:

- **Hardcore**: 3 or fewer. You can die easily, and the world is potentially a dangerous place. Not wearing some kind of protection is begging for death.
- **Standard**: 4 to 6, with 5 as the default assumption for most games. Combat is dangerous and death is always on the table, but you're not completely fragile either.
- **Cinematic**: 7 to 10. You can take several "hits", and so can your opponents. This leads to longer and more elaborate fights.
- **Superheroes**: 11 or more. Long battles with lots of bruises but not many real "injuries". Great for four-color or high fantasy.

## Content Consent

Discussion about content, trigger warnings, making sure everyone's comfortable, etc. I actually want to spend some time one this topic if I ever bother to publish this system, but basically establish boundaries and respect them. Not everyone is comfortable with everything, and that's okay.
