# Connections

Connections are a characteristic that represents things that ground the character in the setting - things, people, places, and so on that they are connected to. Connections can represent many different things, but there is one common thread: they are part of the world outside the character that the character is somehow involved with.

Mechanically, Connections serve multiple purposes. They are resources that can be pulled for checks when appropriate. They also open up possible courses of action for the character, and can be related to [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md).

Basically, Connections are important.

## Building Connections

During [character creation](CharacterCreation.md), you get 4 free Connections, and you can buy more with Adjustment Points. You can use these connections to create four individual connections, or stack them for stronger ties.

Connections are player defined, drawn from their character's background. There are a few general types (see Types of Connection, below), but they all boil down to a short phrase or sentence describing someone, something or some event in the world that the character has ties to.

While [Creating your Character](CharacterCreation.md), you are asked to come up with 4 Connections. Technically, you can stack these, taking the same connection twice, but having more connections means a richer character. Connections should occur to you while you're coming up with your character's background.

### During Game

As an ongoing campaign progresses, you may develop more Connections. Unlike additional [Traits](Traits.md), [Skills](Skills.md), and other Characteristics, you don't use [Advancements](Advancement.md) to improve or gain new Connections. Instead, Connections are in-game play awards.

Players can suggest new Connections whenever they think it's appropriate. This might mean a new Connection (the character has gained the trust of an NPC; the characters were present at an important battle in the war, etc.) or an additional stack for an existing one (the character gains in rank at their organization, or publishing a scientific paper brings more prestige in the academic community).

With or without suggestion, the GM grants Connections when they deem it appropriate. There is no way to accurately schedule this sort of advancement; unlike the regular character advancement, Connection advancement is completely story-dependent.

## Losing Connections

It is possible to lose Connections. This can happen due to story events (an NPC you're connected to dies, you get a burn notice from your spy agency, etc.), or you can Burn your Bridges.

Burning your Bridges happens when you [Burn](Burn.md) a Connection to add to a roll. Unlike other characteristics, burned Connections don't come back automatically or with rest. Sometimes a significant amount of in-game time is sufficient, but often restoring Connections takes a bit more work.

By burning a Connection, you've put a strain on the relationship. This might mean you need to buy a friend flowers, work overtime, or publish a new paper to repair your reputation with the Connection.

If you Burn your stack down to 0 too often, however, things get tricky. If you burn a Connection to 0 more than once, and you roll a 1 with the d8 you gained from burning the Connection, you've called in one favor too many, and the Connection is permanently gone. You might be fired, lose a friend, get disowned, or any of a variety of things. If this happens, you'll have to work to get the Connection back, if it's even possible to do so.

Increasing the stack for the Connection resets this count. This doesn't apply to some Connections; for instance, "Fought Bravely at the Beaches at Normandy" isn't going to go away no matter how many times you burn it. In this case, you regain the Connection after a few hours, but cannot burn it again for a full in-game month (or longer at GM discretion).

## Connections Used Against You

Sometimes, your connections can be used against you. Having a Connection implies some degree of caring or loyalty to the Connection.

The GM may use any of your Connections as a plot hook. Your friend in the DOT might get kidnapped, or someone else who belonged to your unit in the war might need a favor.

You can ignore this sort of thing, but doing so burns the Connection down to a stack of 0, with all the consequences described above. This can even make the character lose Event Connections and things you can't normally permanently lose - if word gets out that your character won't help his fellow veterans, they won't help you either.

## Shared Connections

It's a good idea (but not a requirement) for PCs to have Connections in common. This creates a connection between the characters, and brings the Connection in question more strongly into the setting. There is also a small mechanical advantage.

If two characters have a Connection in common, and they both pull it towards the same task, they can make a single roll instead of rolling separately. You only use the highest stack to count dice, but a number of those dice equal to the lowest stack is rolled as d8s without burning the Connection.

For example, let's say Jack is friends with Bob the Blacksmith (he has the Bob the Blacksmith is my Friend connection with a stack of 1), and Anya is Bob's daughter (she has Bob's Daughter with a stack of 2). Jack and Anya want Bob to forge swords for them, but they don't have any money, so they pull the Connection. Instead of making separate rolls, they go together.

Anya has the highest stack, so they get two dice. Jack's lower stack of 1 means that one of those dice is a d8, so they roll 1d6 and 1d8. If Jack also had a stack of 2, they'd roll 2d8 instead. If Jack had a stack of 4, and Anya had a stack of 3, they'd roll 1d6 and 3d8 - and so on.

## Other PCs as Connections

If you have a previous relationship with another PC, or if PCs have been together for a long time in play, they may take a Connection with each other - something like Jericho and Ash fought in The War together. Connections like this are obviously good for tying characters together both narratively and mechanically.

You can pull this Connection when appropriate to give each other a hand. Continuing the fought in The War example, you might be able to pull the Connection to understand a quick hand sign, or to provide covering fire more effectively than usual.

Connections between PCs can be granted by the GM as awards for surviving a particularly difficult or dramatic event. If all the PCs survived the initial wave of the Zombie Apocalypse, they will have understandably forged a strong connection to one another.

## Types of Connection

Connections are roughly divided into 5 different types based on how they connect you to the world. The types are Personal, Organizational, Social, Environmental, and Temporal.

### Personal

Personal connections are people you know. This might mean close friends, people that owe you favors, family, and so on. You don't need to take a Personal Connection for every person you know, just those that can be counted on to provide regular assistance.

For example, your Mother doesn't need to be taken as a Connection unless she herself is connected (works in the records room at the hospital), is an information resource (has a PhD in parapsychology), or is significantly wealthy.

Just because you don't have an "official" connection with someone doesn't mean you can't ask them for favors. Your mother might be willing to let you stay at her house for a few days even if you don't have the Connection listed on your character sheet, but she probably won't do it no questions asked, and she can't provide material aid that might give you a die to pull.

**Examples**:

- My Mother, who is a retired police officer who has maintained contact with her informants
- My old Gaming Group from High School - Jamie, Kelly, Sam, and Bobby - who all now work in IT
- My kooky rich Uncle Farmer, who's clearly got a screw loose and more money than he knows what to do with

### Organizational

These Connections represent organizations you belong to. An Organizational Connection might mean membership in a club or secret society (you're a Mason!), your place of employment (you're a police officer working for Chicago PD), or anything similar.

**Examples**:

- I'm a cop working for Mars Station PD
- I'm a soldier in the King's army
- I belong to the Skull Society

### Social

Social Connections are things that affect your placement in society, like titles (Dame Babs, Knight of the Realm) or special statuses (a high caste station, or a respected family).

**Examples**:

- I am an actress who's famous for being a B movie scream-queen
- I am a Duke of noble blood
- I am in the Sutarra Caste, and am treated with respect because of it

### Environmental

Environmental Connections are places you are very familiar with. This might mean where you grew up, or a region you've traveled extensively. Environmental Connections grant you geographic and cultural familiarity, and can even provide a new spoken language.

**Examples**:

- I've been hiking the Appalachian Trail since I was 12
- I've been traveling across southeast Asia for more than a decade, where I picked up the Thai and Vietnamese languages
- I've spent a lot of time in deserts, and am comfortable in these environments

### Temporal (Events)

A Temporal Connection means that you were in a particular place at a particular time, and you participated in some way. This forges a connection with everyone else who was there, and, depending on the event, can bring respect, fear, or even animosity with others.

**Examples**:

- I stormed the beaches at Normandy on D-Day
- I was held hostage by the Seventh Dawn during the Corporate Wars
- I was a child soldier in The General's religious army twenty years ago

## Character Creation: What's Next

The next step in [Character Creation](CCSummary.md) is to define [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), if they're being used for your Campaign. Otherwise, skip to selecting up to 5 [Details](Details.md).
