# Character Creation

Everything you need to know to make a playtest character. This page will refer to other pages when needed, but the basics should all be here. I hope.

## Step One - Origin and Aspects

The first thing to do is come up with a basic concept for a character. Got it in mind? We're moving on.

### Origin

**For More Information**: [Origin](Origin.md)

Your concept should lead naturally to your character's Origin. An Origin is a brief description of who the character is and where they're from or what they are. Your Origin should be one or two sentences long, but can just be a few words - it's a quick summary, not a full background.

Your Origin can include a variety of things depending on the setting and genre of the campaign. Things like like species or heritage, where your super powers come from, a profession or social status, education level, and other things can be factored in.

Origins provide certain abilities associated with the origin itself, and also provide story hooks and a guideline for the rest of character creation. Your origin can also sometimes provide an extra die to a check, depending on the circumstances.

When appropriate, an Origin can be pulled into a check to give you an additional die. You can also pull your Origin to add a [Wrinkle](Wrinkles.md) to a scene.

Depending on your [Campaign Parameters](Parameters.md), some parts of your Origin may require you to buy Special Abilities, Traits, or Skills. These are usually bought during normal character generation or with your Adjustments (see below).

#### Example Origins

- I'm a Elf wizard who has spent years researching summoning magic and has a grudge against humans.
- I'm a Storm Equus Weaver who makes friends easily and likes to read comic books.
- By night, I'm a superhero who gained their rabbit-totem powers in an ancient ritual. By day, I'm a high school cheerleader.
- I'm a grizzled war veteran with a deep sense of honor. I've lived for many years in places across South Asia.
- I'm a nerd who spends most of her time in the computer lab and the AV Club who is intensely loyal to her few friends.

### Aspects

**For More Information**: [Aspects](Aspects.md)

You begin the game with two [Aspects](Aspects.md). An Aspect is something your character is good at to the point that it significantly shapes who they are.

Aspects aren't chosen from a list, and are individual to each character. An Aspect can be broad or narrow, and it can be a single word or up to a three word phrase. This leaves you a lot of leeway and can cover a great deal of ground. Your Aspects must, however, say something about your character. They, combined with your Origin, are a shorthand for who your character is and how they approach the world.

Aspects can be pulled into checks just like Traits, except the dice are d8s. Aspects can also be Burned like Traits; when you do, you gain a free Success in addition to using d8s. You only get one free success no matter how big the stack is on your Aspect.

#### Sample Aspects

- Excellent Marksman
- Smooth Talker
- Absolutely fuckin' Gorgeous
- Fearless
- Amature Ninja
- Brilliant Scientist
- Crack shot

## Step Two - Complications

**For More Information**: [Complications](Complications.md)

[Complications](Complications.md) are things about your character that can make life more difficult. Although Complications can sometimes help you out (see below), they're mostly interesting things about your character that can get in the way, especially when dramatically appropriate.

Complications should be role played. For instance, if you take "Use Disorder: Gambling", your character should not just walk down The Strip in Vegas without issues. In addition, whenever you use a Complication to make a scene more difficult for your character, you can either take a [Perk](MarksPerks.md), or restore a [Drama Die](DramaDice.md). Depending on [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md), other options may be available.

There are times when a particular Complication might actually come in handy. For instance, your character might be able to play on the shared experiences of others with the same or similar Complications, or maybe the Complication, while normally presenting a difficulty in your character's life, actually provides them an advantage. The mechanics of circumstances like this can be a bit hard to sort out, but most of the time, when it comes up, you pull the Complication into the roll like a Trait.

There will be a list of Complications, but they're intended as suggestions. Feel free to make up whatever complications you need to fill out your character concept.

### Choosing Complications

While you aren't technically required to take Complications, you should have at least two and no more than four or five. Your first two Complications provide 2 Adjustment Points each (see below). Further Complications provide a single Adjustment Point each. You can get Adjustment Points only for the first five Complications (for a maximum total of 7 bonus Adjustment Points).

The [Complications Page](Complications.md) has a list of suggested Complications to get you started, but players are encouraged to come up with their own complications, either by customizing from the list or by creating their own.

## Step Three - Traits and Skills

Traits and Skills describe what your character is good at and what they know how to do. Traits represent broad abilities, such as being Agile, Strong, or Clever. Skills represent more specific things you know how to do through training, like Tumbling, Martial Arts, or Computers.

In order to make some Checks at all, you must be able to pull at least one Trait or one Skill into the roll.

Traits and Skills aren't the end-all be-all of your character's abilities of course. [Aspects](Aspects.md), [Connections](Connections.md), and sometimes even [Complications](Complications.md) can provide dice for checks, and [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) can change how your dice work and what they can do (although they don't usually actually provide dice).

A new character has 5 Traits and 5 Skills.

### Traits

**For More Information**: [Traits](Traits.md)

Traits are the backbone of a character's abilities. As briefly as possible, they represent what Stats or Ability Scores represent in other games. When making a check, you "pull" whichever Traits make the most sense for what you're doing (along with [Skills](Skills.md) and other factors). Each Trait you Pull provides you with one d6 to roll. Every result of 5+ on the dice is a success.

You begin the game with 5 Traits, but you can gain more through [Advancement](Advancement.md). You can "stack" Traits as well, meaning you can take the same Trait more than once, indicating that it is stronger than usual. Whenever you pull a stacked trait, you gain that many dice for your pool. When you [Burn](Burn.md) a stacked Trait, you use d8s instead of d6s for the whole stack, and its value goes down by one until you get a chance to rest; you don't actually loose access to the Trait until the stack reaches 0.

Traits are loosely divided into categories based on whether they are more Physical, Mental, Social, Sensory, Meta, or Supernatural. Meta and Supernatural Traits may or may not be available depending on the [Parameters](Parameters.md) of the campaign.

There are several Traits in each category. The individual traits will be explained further on the [Traits Page](Traits.md). Basically, they mean what they say on the tin - having the Clever, Determined, and Healthy traits means the character is clever, determined, and healthy.

### Skills

**For More Information**: [Skills](Skills.md)

Skills represent things that your character knows how to do, or knows about. You get 5 during character creation. Like Traits, skills can be Stacked.

When you select a skill, also select a Skill Focus. A Skill Focus is a particular area of the skill you have chosen to give special attention to. Skill Focuses are determined by the Player - there is no specific list, although each Skill's description includes some suggestions. When you Pull a Skill, if it's for something in the Skill Focus, you use a d8 instead of a d6.

## Step Four: Connections

**For More Information**: [Connections](Connections.md)

Connections are things that anchor the character in the world. They might be ways the character knows other PCs, NPCs they care about or have a business relationship with, places they're familiar with, organizations they belong to, and so on. You can sometimes pull a Connection for a check, adding dice to the roll.

Connections used in this way are treated like Traits, except that when they are burned, instead of being unavailable until the character can rest, there are (sometimes severe) role play ramifications. Burning a Connection can mean losing a friend, losing status in an organization, or even gaining an enemy. Burning a connection can cause the character to lose the Connection, never able to access it again, or it can fundamentally change the nature of the connection, or it can even turn the Connection into a Complication.

By default, characters begin with 4 Connections; depending on the campaign [Parameters](Parameters.md), the GM might modify this up or down. At least one of these connections should be to another PC. Connections are designed by the players, preferably working together and in tandem with the GM. Remember that any loved ones, family you are still in close contact with, and other people you are very close to, can all qualify as Connections if the relationship is strong enough.

Some connections imply Skills; for example, "My dad taught me all he knows about Carpentry" implies a Crafting (Carpentry) skill. That's absolutely fine, and the connection can be used in that way, and can be pulled alongside the skill. The connection implies a lot more than just skill in carpentry - in this example, it describes a close relationship with your father, and lots of memories to draw on when your carpenter-ing. These can be more easily used for Stunts when making your skill check.

### Sample Connections

A Connection is a descriptive phrase, a sentence, or even a couple sentences - whatever it takes to describe the Connection. Use the following examples as inspiration.

- Janell - my little sister, who I love
- Greg Thomas - my former business partner; owes me many favors
- Alumni in Good Standing, The Imperial Academy
- Police Officer, Des Moines, Iowa police
- New Defenders - member in good standing
- Chris, my ex-husband, who I still care for deeply
- Simon (Bob's character) thinks I'm probably some kind of witch
- My frail old Aunt May, who I will protect at any cost
- Grew up in The Bronx
- Jimmy saved my life once
- Hiked the Appalachian Trail a few times
- Was raised in the servant's quarters
- Marie's character Tony thinks I'm an expert in Ninjitsu; I'm really, really not
- My mom told me lots of faerie lore when I was a kid
- Raised Catholic
- I'm kinda like Norm from Cheers at the bar on SW86th

## Step Five - Adjustments

You now get 15 Adjustment Points to modify your character. Adjustments allow you to get additional Aspects, Traits, Skills, or Connections, and can also be used to get Details, or to increase your Wound Threshold. If your campaign [Parameters](Parameters.md) include Special Abilities, you can use your Free Points on those as well.

The available Adjustments and their costs can be found here:

**[Adjustment Points](AdjustmentPoints.md)

You don't have to spend all of your Adjustments right now; you can spend them at any time during the first one or two sessions of play as you get a better handle on who your character is and how they do things.

### Details

**For More Information**: [Details](Details.md)

Details are little things that round out your character. Details can be highly specific or situational versions of Traits or Skills, or they can be little things that might come in handy in a somewhat obscure set of circumstances. Affectations, habits, knowledge of a specific category of trivia, or always being up to date on celebrity gossip are all examples. They're just little things that round out your character.

You start out with no more than 5 Details for free. You can have as many as you like, but each one after the fifth costs you an adjustment unless it's gained during play.

If a situation comes up where your Detail comes in handy, you can pull it like a Skill, or burn it to negate a failure.

## Step Five - Special Abilities

**For more information**: [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md)

Special Abilities are things your character can do that are beyond normal human capabilities. Depending on your game, different sorts of Special Abilities might be available. Not all games will allow Special Abilities, and Special Abilities may not always be available during character creation.

Special abilities include things like inherent abilities of your heritage (like all Elves are immune to magical sleep effects, and all Dwarfs can drink twice as much as a human of their weight, for instance), super powers, psychic abilities, the ability to cast spells, martial arts abilities that are beyond normal human ability, cybernetic implants, and so on. Basically, if it wouldn't really work in the real world, it's probably a Special Ability.

If Special Abilities are available in your game, and if you start with them, you usually start with 1. If your Origin includes something that grants you a special ability (such as a non-human race), talk to your GM. Depending on what the heritage (or what have you) grants you, you might be able to take an additional Special Ability.

## Step Six - Wrapping Up

Go through your character with your GM, and talk to any players about Connections with their characters. Find out where you're starting and if there's anything you need to do before you start the game. Equip your character (see [Your Stuff](YourStuff.md)). Add an illustration if you're artistic or you find a picture you like online.

You'll also need to fill in a few blanks. For example:

- **Language**: What is your character's native language? Do they speak any other languages? Are they literate?
- **Physical Description**: How tall is the character? How much to they weigh? What color is their hair, and how do they usually wear it?
- **Style**: How does your character dress? Are they uptight about their appearance, or laid back?
- **Passtimes**: Does your character have any hobbies? Did you give them a Detail for that hobby? What sort of books do they like to read? Do they like to travel, or play video games, or hunt quail?
- **Mood and Personality**: Is the character generally positive? Negative? Manic? Depressed? Is the character an introvert, an extrovert, or something in between? Are they assertive, aggressive, passive, or passive-aggressive?

You don't need to answer all these questions right away; they're just things to think about. You do kind of need to be able to describe your character, and the GM may require you to establish what languages you speak before things get going, but other than that, it's up to you.

And try to have fun!

## Where to Go Next

Any of the links in this article will be helpful once they exist. Other than that, you might want to check out:

- [Conflict](Conflict.md) - how to resolve conflicts, including combat
- [Advancement](Advancement) - how your character gains in experience
- [Parameters](Parameters.md) - you should have read this already, but this is about establishing the setting and goals of the game, along with personal boundaries and how sensitive topics will be handled

Or you could always go to the [Unnamed Index](UnnamedIndex.md). That's always a fun time.
