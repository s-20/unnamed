# NPCs

NPCs use different rules than PCs do to help make a GM's life easier. They don't usually have dice pools at all. Instead, they have flat values used to set [Challenges](Challenge.md) for the Players and to show how good they are at stuff. When Players go up against NPCs, they roll against these values. These values are divided into **Fortes** (things they're excellent at) and **Talents** (things they're just good at).

NPCs also have a [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md), and may have [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md). While similar to the same statistics on a PC, these use slightly different rules for NPCs.

## Level

NPCs have a *level*, which is a numerical value indicating their general competence. Most NPCs will have a level of 2, with higher values for more significant, powerful, or dangerous NPCs.

Because of how levels work, it's best to use even numbers: 2, 4, 6, and so on.

## Fortes

Fortes are things an NPC excels at. Fortes can be listed using [Characteristics](Characteristics.md) like those of a player, or they can be a few sentences outlining the NPC's areas of expertise. When an NPC sets a Challenge for something covered by their Fortes, the [Difficulty](Challenge.md) is equal to the NPC's level. Most NPCs will have only one Forte, but especially powerful or experienced NPCs might have two or more. 

A NPC might also have Specialties within their Fortes. These are more specific than the Forte they're based on, and set Challenges at Level + 1.

## Talents

Talents represent things the NPC knows how to do, but aren't as good at as they are at their Forte. Talents are defined the same way Fortes are (including Specialties), but they set Challenges at 1/2 the NPC's level, or 1 + 1/2 level for Specialties.

### Untalented

Anything the NPC does that's outside both Forte and Talent is considered Untalented. Untalented actions can usually be defeated by PCs automatically; if the PC can put together a Dice Pool, they beat the NPC, with any [Effort](Effort.md) usable for [Stunts](Stunts.md) or [Overkill](Overkill.md).

More powerful NPCs can use their Endurance (see below) to bolster Untalented actions at a 1 for 1 rate, up to a maximum of 2 or 1/2 their level, whichever is lower.

### Teamwork

You may notice that higher level NPCs may set unreasonably high Difficulties. PCs can use teamwork to pool successes in a single round, action, or scene to reach these difficulties. In other words, they can focus their efforts, working together through tactics or similar methods, to pool a single effort. 

This allows for climactic battles that require the heroes to work together to defeat a powerful foe. Instead of combining individual actions, the PCs will have to work together to “stack” their collective abilities. 

## Wound Threshold and Endurance

An NPC's Wound Threshold works the same way a PC's does. When taking damage in [Combat](Combat.md). NPCs start with a Wound Threshold equal to their Level. You can then tweak the value up or down by a few points if they're especially tough or fragile.

Major NPCs (those of level 4 or higher) also have Endurance, usually at 5x their Wound Threshold. Attacks that deal Wound damage deal Endurance damage instead. In addition, Endurance is used to fuel any Special Abilities they might have in place of a normal [Energy](Energy.md) pool. Every 5 points of Endurance damage reduces the NPC's effective level when determining Challenges by 1.

## Description

A NPC's description is actually an important part of their *character sheet*. It tells you whether to use Forte or Talent pools, along with any [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) the NPC might have. You should also include a few weaknesses and some background information when describing the NPC. You can handle all this by listing skills or traits as sort of *meta characteristics* if you like, or just describe them in general terms, getting specific about their areas of expertise.

## Scrubs

Scrubs are low-level NPCs that provide some opposition to the PCs, but not a major challenge. These are the nameless thugs the NPC sends at the main characters of a story, random people on the street, most animals, and so on. Scrubs don't have Fortes, Talents, or even Wound Thresholds. Instead, the just have a Difficulty from 1 to 3. They are essentially treated as just another task to be overcome.

Scrubs usually fold after one or two hits, getting taken out of action or killed as established either by player description or the campaign's [Parameters](Parameters.md). Scrubs can provide 1 [Synergy](Synergy.md) automatically by assisting to a maximum of 2 Synergy total (regardless of how many scrubs are helping).
