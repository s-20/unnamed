# Death

Death is the big "Back to Character Creation" moment for most characters. It means the character has shuffled off this mortal coil. They're pushing up the daisies, they've kicked the bucket, run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible.

They are an Ex Character.

## The Dying Condition

When character is on the brink of death, they may gain the Dying [Condition](Conditions.md). The Dying Condition is usually reserved for [Combat](Combat.md) or similar intense short conflicts, but it can be thrown in whenever it might up the stakes.

A character gains the Dying in three main ways - when they have Wounds equal to their [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md), when they take [Massive Damage](WoundThreshold.md), or as a result of poison or similar effects.

The Dying Condition has the following effects:

- The character gains the [Off Balance Condition](Conditions.md) if they don't already have it
- Taking more then one action in a round increases the Dying conditions's stack by 1 for each action taken, but any dice they pull for that action are d8s
- If the character does not receive first aid of some kind, they must make a Death Check at the end of their turn - see [Wound Threshold](WoundThreshold.md).

If the character's Dying stack ever equals their Wound Threshold, that's it - they're beyond help, and are going to die. The character may die immediately, or they may get one final Heroic Action.

## Heroic Action

A dying character always gets a chance to utter last words - or even last paragraphs, if dramatically appropriate. Alternately (or in addition, if it seems like fun), they may take one final action of some kind - arming the bomb as they collapse, throwing a dagger at the BBG, leaping in front of an ally to take the bullet, or whatever else occurs to you.

A Heroic Action should be taken very soon after the character's fate is sealed. In combat, it must be within two rounds of gaining their final stack in the Dying Condition; out of combat, it's a bit more relaxed - it should be very soon, but it should also be dramatically appropriate, so there's more latitude.

Heroic Actions always at least partially succeed. If the action requires a Check, you always use d8s instead of d6s, and you ignore Failures (i.e. they don't cancel Successes, and cannot cause a Disaster; see [The Core Rules](HBCore.md)).

## The Death Rant

In a great many settings under a variety of circumstances, death isn't always the end. There are a lot of different ways characters can "come back":

- In Dungeons & Dragons, spells like Raise Dead and Resurrection have almost trivialized character death
- In superhero comics, coming back from the dead (often with new or improved powers!) is a trope so common as to be cliché
- In the film Beerfest (spoiler alert), one character dies. At his funeral, his twin brother shows up, joins the gang, and insists on being called by his dead brother's nickname - effectively, the character came back!
- The RPG Paranoia has a whole... thing about dying. It's all good, though - you've got a mostly-updated clone standing by, so no worries
- Several transhuman sci-fi games have something along the lines of a "cortical stack" - essentially, your soul and experiences in removable form that can be placed in a new body when you die
- In a similar fashion, many high-tech sci-fi settings can bring someone back from death if they get medical attention soon enough. In the movie The Fifth Element, all they need is a few cells (which is silly, but so's the rest of the movie)

The Unnamed System doesn't provide rules for coming back from death, however. The default assumption is that death is the end. However, depending on your established [Parameters](Parameters.md), it may not be.

That's cool, but it shouldn't be something covered by the mechanics of a game. Instead, it should be handled on a case-by-case or setting-by-setting thing.

Establish your own "rules", or make them up on the spot when you need them. And by "rules" I mean "some story-related plot hook or feature of the setting" not which dice to throw or which [Energy Pool](Energy.md) to deplete.

Even if it comes down to "cast a spell" or "stick his stack in a new body", make it part of the story in some way. If it's a spell, maybe it requires an exotic component, or a ritual that can be interrupted by the character's adversaries. If it's a cortical stack, remember that bodies can be hard to come by, and you don't always get the one you want.

Whatever it is, make it interesting. I wrote an entire in-setting legend to justify resurrection being impossible for my fantasy setting because I was tired of death being trivial, and it seemed like the best way to handle it.

I can now admit I was wrong, but my point still stands - unless your game is subverting it for some reason, Death should mean something.
