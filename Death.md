# Death

Death is the big “Back to Character Creation” moment for most characters. It means the character has shuffled off this mortal coil. They're pushing up the daisies, they've kicked the bucket, run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible.

They are an *Ex Character*.

## Heroic Action

A dying character always gets a chance to utter last words, or even last paragraphs if dramatically appropriate. Sometimes, they may take one final action of some kind, like arming the bomb as they collapse, throwing a dagger at the Bad Guy, leaping in front of an ally to take the bullet, or whatever else occurs to you. When the Heroic Action is take in flexible, and it doesn't have to be right away, as long as it's in the same scene.

Heroic Actions gain 5 [Synergy](Synergy.md) on the check, if a Check is required at all, and should provide a significant benefit to the character's allies. Since the character is dying anyway, there is absolutely no reason not to burn any Characteristics you can for the check, so keep that in mind when you're pulling dice.

Heroic Action doesn't apply to all [NPCs](NPCs.md), but it does apply to major antagonists and their second-in-commands. NPCs don't get [Synergy](Synergy.md), though — see the NPC rules for more information. 

Remember the scenes at the end of The Wrath of Kahn - Kahn arming the Genesis Device, and Spock saving the day in the warp drive chamber and his subsequent scene with Kirk. These were final Heroic Actions for the respective characters, just to give you and idea of what we're talking about.
