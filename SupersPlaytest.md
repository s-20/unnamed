# Supers Playtest: The First Age of Heroes

These are the notes for the Supers game that I plan to use as a playtest for my game system.

## Campaign Core

- We're going to build our own Supers universe
  - The actual plan is for it to intersect with New Defenders-verse, but that's late-game stuff (something about Nacht and Iron Cross, probably during World War II)
- Core Stuff:
  - You are a college student. You age is irrelevant, but you are a full time student at Copper Mountain Community College (CMCC), and you live on campus.
    - CMCC is located in Cobre, Arizona - long ago a mining town, now the recently named Capitol City of Arizona, and the fastest growing city in the country
    - Population comparable to Denver (with similar amenities)
  - There have never been Super Powers in your world before, as far as you know. You are a First Generation Super.

### Character Creation

- Something just happened - like, yesterday. At 7 PM. What was it?
- Powers can be defined in a single sentence, e.g.:
  - I have the proportional attributes of a Spider, granted to me because I am the Spider Totem for this layer of the Multiverse
  - I am a normal guy, unless I get angry, and if that happens my unmatchable strength and indestructability are fueled by my anger.
  - I am the Sorcerer Supreme for this world, and all realities bend to my will - although I only found out yesterday.
  - I can tap into a force that allows me to accelerate to a phenomenal speeds
  - I am essentially made of silly-putty and can stretch and shape myself in any way I can imagine.
  - Basically, if you have a power, it has to be something that can be encapsulated in a single text box at the start of an issue in the comic - a text box small enough that all your teammates could be described on the same page.
