# Supers Playtest: The First Age of Heroes

These are the notes for the Supers game that I plan to use as a playtest for my game system.

## Campaign Core

- We're going to build our own Supers universe
  - The actual plan is for it to intersect with New Defendersverse, but that's late-game stuff (something about Nacht and Iron Cross, probably during World War II)
- Basically anything is on the table, power wise, with the following caveats:
  - You are a college student. You age is irrelevant, but you go to Copper Mountain Community College (CMCC), and you live on campus.
    - CMCC is located in Cobre, Arizona - long ago a mining town, now the recently named Capitol City of Arizona, and the fastest growing city in the country
    - Population comparable to Denver (with similar amenities)
  - Something just happened - some magical, cosmic, psychic, or whatever event - and it happened on campus, and most (if not all) of you were present.
  - You either have a Power or you're Superman, or you're Batman (I'll explain, I promise).
    - If you have a Power, that Power must be defined in a single sentence. Famous examples:
      - I have the proportional attributes of a Spider, granted to me because I am the Spider Totem for this layer of the Multiverse
      - I am a normal guy, unless I get angry, and if that happens my unmatchable strength and indestructability are fueled by my anger.
      - I am the Sorcerer Supreme for this world, and all realities bend to my will - although I only found out yesterday.
      - I can tap into a force that allows me to accelerate to a phenomenal speeds
      - I am essentially made of silly-putty and can stretch and shape myself in any way I can imagine.
    - Basically, if you have a power, it has to be something that can be encapsulated in a single text box at the start of an issue in the comic - a text box small enough that all your teammates could be described on the same page.
    - *Batman* - If you're taking the Batman route, you are on a spectrum between ultimate resource access ultimate physical training, but all within the bounds of being human. Examples:
      - I am super-rich. Like, really, really rich. Like, Jeff Bezos can't conceptualize the resources I have access to. I am COMIC BOOK RICH. Physically, though, I got a black belt in Tae Kwon Do form my personal trainer, but his name was Chad Everton, and he thinks that Pho is Korean.
      - I'm very wealthy. Wealthy enough to have traveled the world, seeking teachers of every martial art I could find to instruct me. Sure, my buisiness interests kept me from finding the really obscure stuff, but I'm
