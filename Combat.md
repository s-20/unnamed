# Combat

Primarily geared towards physical altercations, Combat can be used to simulate other things - basically, any situation where tactics or an organized turn order would benefit play, you can haul out the combat system. In the rules outlined here, the focus is kept on the physical altercation stuff.

## General Principles

There are two types of Combat - [Skirmishes](Skirmish.md) for small and fast events that can be resolved quickly to keep the plot moving, and [Engagement](Engagement.md), which involves multiple "rounds" and a specific turn order. Skirmishes usually just involve description and a few checks, while Engagement is a more elaborate setup using battle maps or range bands, multiple rounds with a turn order, and more rules to keep things organized and tactically interesting.

## Skirmish

In movies, comics, and anime, there are frequently scenes, usually when the heroes are running down a corridor, when they briefly exchange fire/clash swords/whatever with some low-level thugs, robot gun turrets, and so on. These scenes provide a quick flash of action, but don't last long, and seldom result in injury to the protagonists. These are Skirmishes.

A Skirmish doesn't require a battle map, and is resolved with some quick description a a couple throws of the dice, usually a single exchange between the players and their opponents. Use the following steps:

1. **The GM sets the scene**: The GM provides a quick description of what's going on, prompting action:
   - *As you rush down the corridor, four turrets pop out of the ceiling and open fire!*
2. **The Players react**: Each player takes a second to react, calling out their immediate reactions to the situation:
   - *I throw myself to the ground!*
   - *I dive behind Bob and fire from under his arm!*
   - *I open up with my Gatling gun!*
3. **Everyone Rolls**: Player pull their dice pools together, and the GM rolls a number of dice based on the difficulty of the encounter
   - If the players get more successes than the GM, they win the encounter, describe their victory, and continue
   - If the GM gets more successes, the GM's dice pool is reduced by an amount equal to the successes rolled by the Players and some of the players resources are depleted - someone runs out of ammo, someone sustains minor injury (but not usually a [Wound](WoundThreshold.md)), someone loses [Energy](Energy.md), etc.; describe what happens and return to Step 2.
   - If no one rolls any successes or there's a tie, the GM's dice pool is reduced by 2; go back to Step 2.
   - If there are [Quirks](HBCore.md) in the roll, something odd might happen. If any one character or the GM get *a lot* of quirks, then something big might happen, provided it keeps the story moving and doesn't hurt the players too much.

And that's it - once the players get more successes than their opponents, you move on. You can take as much time with descriptions and such as you want, and players can use [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md)/[Stuff](YourStuff.md) freely without [Energy](Energy.md) or other resource costs. Any [Burned](Burn.md) [Characteristics](Characteristics.md) are still Burned, and are reduced as the characters go on.

The whole idea is a quick, fun action scene where the players can show off a little with minimal risk on their way to something bigger - a big RP opportunity, or maybe an Engagement.

For more details, see [Skirmish Rules](Skirmish.md).

## Engagement

Full [Engagements](Engagement.md) are for major conflicts and tactical maneuvering. In an Engagement, everyone should have something interesting to do every round. Teamwork, maneuvering, and tactics are all important.

A Full Engagement round uses the following structure:

- **Prepare** - The Engagement begins; the GM sets the scene and the Battle Map is set up or Range Bands are established. Unless they're surprised, all the characters get a brief window to maneuver, draw weapons, charge powers, and so on.
- **Determine Initiative** - This can be established each round, or can be set at the begining and followed throughout the combat. Either way, players pull Characteristics for the Initiative Pool and everyone rolls, counting successes. Successes are spent to claim Turns in the combat. Once all the Turns are claimed, proceed.
- **Start of Round** - Attempts to throw off effects are made. Any new *Events* go into effect, and then Turn Order begins.
- **Turn Begins** - An individual player's (or opponent's) turn begins with throwing off Turn based effects that have come to an end, and then declaring intent.
- **Pull Dice and Make Checks** - Pull dice pools togather and make checks. You get 2 *actions*, or big things you can do - maneuver, attack, declare defense, and so on. Gather any dice pools you need and make your Checks, then note any [Burn](Burn.md) or otehr changes. Total your [Effort](Effort.md).
- **Resolve Turn** - Describe what happens, and move minitures to where they belong or note changes to Range Bands. Declare the end of your turn. Any turn-based Effect durations that resolve this round end. Play passes to the next turn, going back to the Turn Begins phase above.
- **Round Ends** - Once all turns are complete, resolve any End of Round effects. If the Engagement still has participants, go back to either Start of Round or Initiative, depending on whether you're doing initiative round-by-round or for the whole Engagement.
- **Resolution** - Engagement ends, anything that needs to be wrapped up at the end of the Engagement (after-action reviews, noting a scene change, etc.) happens now. If the scene ends, players restore 2 Burned Traits as the adrenaline wears off.

### Battlemaps and Range Bands

The battlemap is just a way to keep track of where everyone is in relation to each other, and where people are in relation to effects or events that take place over an area (Area Effects).

This document refers to distances in "squares", referencing a 1 inch or 2 cm square grid, with each square usually representing 2 yards or 2 meters. That doesn't mean you have to use a square grid, though; there's nothing in the system that requires it. You can just as easily use a hex grid or even just measure distances as you would with wargaming miniatures. "Squares" is just a handy reference term.

If you're not using Battle Maps, each player should track Range Bands - that is, where they are relative to one another. Ranges are divived into Immediate, Near, Far, Distant, and Tactical. See [Range Bands](RangeBands.md) for more details.
