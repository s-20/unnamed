# Combat

Primarily geared towards physical altercations, Combat can be used to simulate other things - basically, any situation where tactics or an organized turn order would benefit play, you can haul out the combat system. In the rules outlined here, the focus is kept on the physical altercation stuff.

## General Principles

There are two types of Combat - [Skirmishes](Skirmish.md) for small and fast events that can be resolved quickly to keep the plot moving, and [Engagement](Engagement.md), which involves multiple "rounds" and a specific turn order. Skirmishes usually just involve description and a few checks, while Engagement is a more elaborate setup using battle maps or range bands, multiple rounds with a turn order, and more rules to keep things organized and tactically interesting.

## Skirmish

In movies, comics, and anime, there are frequently scenes, usually when the heroes are running down a corridor, when they briefly exchange fire/clash swords/whatever with some low-level thugs, robot gun turrets, and so on. These scenes provide a quick flash of action, but don't last long, and seldom result in injury to the protagonists. These are Skirmishes.

A Skirmish doesn't require a battle map, and is resolved with some quick description a a couple throws of the dice, usually a single exchange between the players and their opponents. Use the following steps:

1. **The GM sets the scene**: The GM provides a quick description of what's going on, prompting action:
   - *As you rush down the corridor, four turrets pop out of the ceiling and open fire!*
2. **The Players react**: Each player takes a second to react, calling out their immediate reactions to the situation:
   - *I throw myself to the ground!*
   - *I dive behind Bob and fire from under his arm!*
   - *I open up with my Gatling gun!*
3. **Everyone Rolls**: Player pull their dice pools together, and the GM rolls a number of dice based on the difficulty of the encounter
   - If the players get more successes than the GM, they win the encounter, describe their victory, and continue
   - If the GM gets more successes, the GM's dice pool is reduced by an amount equal to the successes rolled by the Players and some of the players resources are depleted - someone runs out of ammo, someone sustains minor injury (but not usually a [Wound](WoundThreshold.md)), someone loses [Energy](Energy.md), etc.; describe what happens and return to Step 2.
   - If no one rolls any successes or there's a tie, the GM's dice pool is reduced by 2; go back to Step 2.
   - If there are [Quirks](HBCore.md) in the roll, something odd might happen. If any one character or the GM get *a lot* of quirks, then something big might happen, provided it keeps the story moving and doesn't hurt the players too much.

And that's it - once the players get more successes than their opponents, you move on. You can take as much time with descriptions and such as you want, and players can use [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md)/[Stuff](YourStuff.md) freely without [Energy](Energy.md) or other resource costs. Any [Burned](Burn.md) [Characteristics](Characteristics.md) are still Burned, and are reduced as the characters go on.

The whole idea is a quick, fun action scene where the players can show off a little with minimal risk on their way to something bigger - a big RP opportunity, or maybe an Engagement.

For more details, see [Skirmish Rules](Skirmish.md).

## Engagement

Full Engagements are for major conflicts and tactical maneuvering. In an Engagement, everyone should have something interesting to do every round. Teamwork, maneuvering, and tactics are all important.

A Full Engagement round uses the following structure:

- **Prepare** - The Engagement begins; the GM sets the scene and the Battle Map is set up or Range Bands are established. Unless they're surprised, all the characters get a brief window to maneuver, draw weapons, charge powers, and so on.
- **Determine Initiative** - This can be established each round, or can be set at the begining and followed throughout the combat. Either way, players pull Characteristics for the Initiative Pool and everyone rolls, counting successes. Successes are spent to claim Turns in the combat. Once all the Turns are claimed, proceed.
- **Start of Round** - Round-based Durations and effects are resolved.

## Set Scene

Everything starts with the GM setting the scene, describing the area and situation. Set up a battlemap, assign miniatures to those involved, and get things rolling.

### Battlemaps

The battlemap is just a way to keep track of where everyone is in relation to each other, and where people are in relation to effects or events that take place over an area (Area Effects).

This document refers to distances in "squares", referencing a 1 inch or 2 cm square grid, with each square usually representing 2 yards or 2 meters. That doesn't mean you have to use a square grid, though; there's nothing in the system that requires it. You can just as easily use a hex grid or even just measure distances as you would with wargaming miniatures. "Squares" is just a handy reference term.

You also don't have to use a battlemap at all, if you can keep track of things in your head. Theater of the Mind battles are fine, and there's nothing in the rules here that specifically requires a map. A battlemap can help to end arguments about positioning before they start, and are a useful visualization tool, but they're not required.

## Determine Initiative

The unnamed System divides turn order into groups depending on who is participating in the combat. Each "side" of the battle gets a turn. So if the players are together and fighting a single opposing force, the players get a turn and the enemies get a turn.

Initiative for a group is usually determined by common sense, favoring the players. If it makes more sense for the opponents to go first, however, they go first.

If you want to make it more random or divide up turns per player, players should pull dice for a roll. Instead of counting successes, however, you total the dice, with highest going first. The GM should roll the largest [dice pool](NPCs.md) among the NPCs.

## Round Begins

A round is divided into four parts: Declaration, Pull Dice, Resolution, and End. During each phase. all players get one (or possibly more) Actions - things they can do. What a player can do depends on the phase:

- **Declaration**: Players declare their intents for the round, describing what they want to accomplish
- **Pull Dice**: Players pull dice for the actions they intend to take. Players may only pull an individual [Aspect](Aspects.md) or [Trait](Traits.md) once in a round unless they [Burn](Burn.md) it.
- **Resolution**: Players and GM roll dice and compare results. This isn't a contest like the Quick Engagement; see below.
- **End**: Based on Resolution, describe what happens and make sure everyone is where they need to be for the next round. End of Round effects resolve/end.

If, after the End Round step, there is no longer a battle to be had (all but one side is dead/unconscious/captured/has escaped, or all sides want to quit), then combat is over. Otherwise, return to Declaration and keep going.

### Declare Intent

Each round represents five to ten seconds of time (sometimes longer). During declaration, you can generally say you're doing anything that can be accomplished within that timeframe.

Character actions aren't divided into discrete actions as such; instead, the players discuss their tactics and declare what they intend to do. As long as it's reasonable that the characters can do what they're trying to do in five to ten seconds, everything's fine.

**Example:** *Jake wants to providing covering fire for Kara while she tries to close with the vampire. Once she gets to the vampire, Kara wants to do a takedown move and attempt to stake him, while Jake turns his attention to providing suppressing fire to keep the vampire's minions away.*

#### Intent Guidelines

- A character can move about 6 squares (12 yards/meters) easily (there's some wiggle room there depending on what else you're trying to do). Moving further may have consequences - you might be easier to hit, or have to make a check, or lose dice on other checks you make
- Characters that have combat skills can usually make more attacks (depending on the weapon) than those who don't
- [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) may have limitations on usage within a round
- As you declare intents, keep in mind the rules below under Pull Dice. What you do limits what else you can do in a round.

### Pull Dice

Once intent is declared, players pull the dice pools they'll need for the round. You may only use a given [Trait](Traits.md) or [Aspect](Aspects.md) once in a round unless you Burn it; Characteristics that are Burned can be used again, or can be used before they're burned.

[Skills](Skills.md), on the other hand, can be used as many times in a rounds as is appropriate.
