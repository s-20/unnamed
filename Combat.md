# Combat

I'm going to be upfront with you - when it comes to RPG design, making combat fun is where I have the least confidence. Any and all ideas and feedback are welcome.

## General Principles

The unnamed System uses a battle map for any full-scale combat. Minor skirmishes, on the other hand (any fight that should be resolved within a minute or so) are handled with an exchange of skill checks.

This means that there are two kinds of combat - Descriptive or Quick Engagements and Full Engagements. Each use their own rules and are designed for different circumstances.

## Quick Engagement

In movies, comics, and anime, there are frequently scenes, usually when the heroes are running down a corridor, when they briefly exchange fire/clash swords/whatever with some low-level thugs, robot gun turrets, and so on. 

These scenes provide a quick flash of action, but don't last long, and seldom result in injury to the protagonists. These are Quick Engagements.

A Quick Engagement doesn't require a battle map, and is resolved with some quick description a a couple throws of the dice, usually a single exchange between the players and their opponents. Use the following steps:

1. **The GM sets the scene**: As you rush down the corridor, four turrets pop out of the ceiling and open fire!
2. **The Players react**: "I throw myself to the ground!" "I dive behind Bob and fire from under his arm!" "I open up with my Gatling gun!"
3. **Everyone Rolls**: Player pull their dice pools together, and the GM rolls a number of dice based on the difficulty of the encounter (starting at 2 per player, up to 5 per player; anything bigger probably needs a Full Engagement).
   1. If the players get more successes than the GM, they win the encounter, describe their victory, and continue
   2. If the GM gets more successes, the players don't win; describe what happens, the GM's dice pool is reduced by 1 per player, then go back to Step 2
   3. If one of the players rolls a Disaster (see [Core Rules](HBCore.md)), they loose [resources](YourStuff.md), take a [wound](WoundThreshold.md), or must Burn an Aspect - whatever is appropriate

   And that's it - once the players get more successes than their opponents, you move on. You can take as much time with descriptions and such as you want, and players can use [Special Abilities](SpecialAbilities.md) freely - they only lose resources or [Energy](Energy.md) if they throw a Disaster.

   Players can, of course, burn their Traits and so on if they like, but the whole idea is a quick, fun action scene where the players can show off a little with minimal risk on their way to something bigger - a big RP opportunity, or maybe a Full Engagement.

## Full Engagement

Full Engagements are for things like BBGs and their lieutenants or other bigger events.

The idea here is to make it so that everyone has something interesting to do every round, and to make every round engaging for every player. Teamwork, maneuvering, and tactics are all important.
