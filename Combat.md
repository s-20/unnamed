# Combat

You can't talk your way out of everything, and for the rest, there's combat.

## Descriptive Combat

In the unnamed system, Combat is descriptive. THat means that if you want good results, you need to say more than "I swing my sword" or "I hit him with an eye blast". You can do those things, no problem - roll your dice, if you get at least one success, you'll deal a wound or whatever.

If, on the other hand, you say "I continue to parry, looking for an opening, then I try to knock his sword away and step in, jamming my blade under his ribs" and roll the dice, you can gain an extra die for defense ("I continue to parry"), give your opponent a penalty to hit you ("knock his sword away"), and can deal more than a single wound ("jamming m blade under his ribs").

You don't need a long list of abilities to do things like inflict common sense [Conditions](Conditions.md) - you just have to describe things well. Use the environment your GM has described, and ask for more information if you need it. Knock people's heads into stuff for a quick Stun status (see [Statuses](#Statuses), below). Talk smack about your opponent's mother's pies to drive your opponent to Frenzy. Explain why your sword strike deserves more than one wound.

In short - describe what you're doing and you can ask for a specific benefit, or the GM can assign one, or another player can suggest one. The benefits can vary, but here are some samples:

- **Extra Damage**: You deal an additional Wound of damage on a success, perhaps more depending on your description
- **Inflict Condition**: Inflict a [Condition](Conditions.md) on an opponent; you'll usually need at least two successes, and you might not deal any damage
- **Throw a Status**: Your opponent gains a [Status](#statuses) in  addition to taking a wound
- **Improve Defensive Position**: Your defensive position improves, giving you an additional Die for any Defense checks you make until your next turn or until an opponent hits you
- **Maneuver**: Dramatically change your position on the battlefield - run a ways, charge someone, climb a tree...
- **Perform a [Stunt](Stunts.md)**: Gain one or more dice for especially great descriptions or cool actions

## Goals and Action Types

Each round you get three actions by default. In unnamed, the definition of an Action is quite broad - it can mean running across a room to stab someone, kicking open a door, or performing a complex spell. With an Action, you try to accomplish a Goal:

- *Offensive Goal*: You're trying to harm or impede your opponent.
- *Defensive Goal*: You're trying to bolster your defenses, making yourself harder to harm
- *Tactical Goal*: You're trying to improve your tactical position, maneuver around the battlefield, or support an ally

You use Actions to try to accomplish these goals, with each Action representing an attempt. You don't have to use all your actions on your turn (in fact, it's often better if you don't).

When you use an action on your turn, it's called an Action. When you use an action in response to something someone else did, it's called a Reaction.

### Actions

Actions are the normal things you do during the battle, usually Offensive or Tactical in nature. You swing a sword, you cast a spell, you book it across the battlefield, and so on.

You declare what you're trying to do and, if necessary, pull your dice pool. The GM informs you of adverse actions taken by opponents, and you're given an opportunity to modify your action. Then the GM informs you of any penalties, and you roll.

An Action can be a lot of things, as discussed previously. Very roughly speaking, an action is something you can accomplish within 5 or so seconds. You might run up to someone and swing your sword, fire your gun twice, or cast a quick spell.

If it's going to take a bit more than 5 seconds to accomplish, then you'll need to use a second Action to complete your task. THis is called a Continuing Action, and it can carry over from one round to another. 

For example, if you're trying to open a lock while your allies fight off attackers, the GM might say "That's going to take you about half a minute!". You'll need to spend roughly 6 actions on picking the lock. This could mean it's done in two rounds, or it could take you longer if you're interrupted.

### Reactions

When you do something in immediate response to what someone else does, it's a Reaction. Reactions are actions spent when it isn't your turn.

Reactions work exactly like Actions, except they're triggered by something someone else did. They're resolved immediately, and can come in the middle of someone else's action.

For example, an opponent might charge across the battlefield, to which you could say "I'm going to parry" or "I dodge left!" in response.

Generally speaking, your dice pool is reduced by 1 when you're making a Reaction.
