# Combat

You can't talk your way out of everything, and for the rest, there's combat.

## General Principles

## A Round

## Descriptive Combat

In the unnamed system, Combat is descriptive. THat means that if you want good results, you need to say more than "I swing my sword" or "I hit him with an eye blast". You can do those things, no problem - roll your dice, if you get at least one success, you'll deal a wound or whatever.

If, on the other hand, you say "I continue to parry, looking for an opening, then I try to knock his sword away and step in, jamming my blade under his ribs" and roll the dice, you can gain an extra die for defense ("I continue to parry"), give your opponent a penalty to hit you ("knock his sword away"), and can deal more than a single wound ("jamming m blade under his ribs").

You don't need a long list of abilities to do things like inflict common sense [Conditions](Conditions.md) - you just have to describe things well. Use the environment your GM has described, and ask for more information if you need it. Knock people's heads into stuff for a quick Stun status (see [Statuses](#Statuses), below). Talk smack about your opponent's mother's pies to drive your opponent to Frenzy. Explain why your sword strike deserves more than one wound.

In short - describe what you're doing and you can ask for a specific benefit, or the GM can assign one, or another player can suggest one. The benefits can vary, but here are some samples:

- **Extra Damage**: You deal an additional Wound of damage on a success, plus one more wound for each success past the first
- **Inflict Condition**: Inflict a [Condition](Conditions.md) on an opponent; you'll usually need at least two successes, and you might not deal any damage
- **Throw a Status**: Your opponent gains a [Status](#statuses) in  addition to taking a wound
- **Improve Defensive Position**: Your defensive position improves, giving you an additional Die for any Defense checks you make until your next turn or until an opponent hits you
- **Maneuver**: Dramatically change your position on the battlefield - run a ways, charge someone, climb a tree...
- **Perform a [Stunt](Stunts.md)**: Gain one or more dice for especially great descriptions or cool actions

## Goals and Action Types

Each round you get three actions by default. In unnamed, the definition of an Action is quite broad - it can mean running across a room to stab someone, kicking open a door, or performing a complex spell. With an Action, you try to accomplish a Goal:

- *Offensive Goal*: You're trying to harm or impede your opponent.
- *Defensive Goal*: You're trying to bolster your defenses, making yourself harder to harm
- *Tactical Goal*: You're trying to improve your tactical position, maneuver around the battlefield, or support an ally

You use Actions to try to accomplish these goals, with each Action representing an attempt. You don't have to use all your actions on your turn (in fact, it's often better if you don't).

When you use an action on your turn, it's called an Action. When you use an action in response to something someone else did, it's called a Reaction. When you use an Action to try to prevent someone else from doing something, it's an Interrupt.
